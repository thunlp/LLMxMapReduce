map_prompt: "You are provided with a portion of an article and a question. Read the article portion and follow my instructions to process it.\n\nArticle:\nThe article begins as follows:\n{context}\nThe article concludes here.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nInstructions:\n\nPlease extract information from the provided passage to try and answer the given question. Note that you only have a part of the entire text, so the information you obtain might not fully answer the question. Therefore, please provide your rationale for using the extracted information to answer the question and include a confidence score. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract Relevant Information: Identify and highlight the key pieces of information from the passage that are relevant to the given question.\n2. Rationale: Analyze the extracted information and explain how it can be used to address the question. If the information is incomplete, discuss any assumptions or inferences you need to make.\n3. Answer the Question: Based on your rationale, provide the best possible answer to the question.If, after providing your rationale, you believe the passage does not contain any information to solve the question, please output \"[NO INFORMATION]\" as the answer.\n4. Confidence Score: Give a confidence score (out of 5) for your final answer based on the completeness, relevance, and reliability of the integrated information and your rationale process. Reflect on how well the rationale addresses the question and the likelihood that the answer is correct.\nPlease follow this format:\n\nExtracted Information:\nRationale:\nAnswer:\nConfidence Score:"

collapse_prompt: "You need to process a task with a long context that greatly exceeds your context limit. The only feasible way to handle this is by processing the long context chunk by chunk. You are provided with a question and some information extracted from each chunk. Each piece of information contains Extracted Information, Rationale, Answer, and a Confidence Score. Read the information and follow my instructions to process it.\n\nExtracted Information:\nThe extracted information begins as follows:\n{context}\nThe extracted information concludes here.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nInstruction:\n\nIntegrate the extracted information and then reason through the following steps:\n\n1. Integrate Extracted Information: Collect and summarize all the evidence relevant to solving the question. Focus on integrating the information from different chunks, rather than just relying on confidence scores. Ensure to extract the most relevant information that addresses the question effectively.\n2. Analyze: Re-analyze the question using the integrated information. Consider the reliability (confidence scores) and how directly each piece of information addresses the question. Prioritize highly relevant information while accounting for potential errors due to incomplete data.\n3. Answer the Question: Provide the best possible answer based on the updated information. If, after providing your rationale, you believe the passage does not contain any information to solve the question, please output \"[NO INFORMATION]\" as the answer. Use the confidence scores to support the reliability of your final answer, prioritizing higher confidence information.\n4. Assign Confidence Score: Give a confidence score (out of 5) for your final answer based on the completeness, relevance, and reliability of the integrated information and your rationale process. Reflect on how well the rationale addresses the question and the likelihood that the answer is correct.\nPlease follow this format:\n\nExtracted Information:\nRationale:\nAnswer:\nConfidence Score:"

reduce_prompt: "Given the task below: {question}, provide a final answer (or solution) based on these following evidence: {context}.If any segment possess a 5-point confidence score, prioritize these information and disregard others，else consider the confidence scores to prioritize more reliable information.Your answer can not mention the confidence score."
