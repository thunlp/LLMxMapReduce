Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him. Across the bay, Pete puts the finishing touch on her painting. She makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her brush down, finally having achieved her vision."]}

Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze.

He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime.

Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran.

{"id": 4, "prediction": "The summaries provided encompass narratives from various books, primarily set in the racially segregated American South, focusing on young protagonists navigating complex social dynamics in small towns. The stories intertwine themes of family, coming of age, racial tensions, and social norms, primarily centered around Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and other fictional narratives.\n\nIn \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" we follow the experiences of Scout Finch and her brother Jem (also referred to as Carsen in some summaries), as they grow up in Maycomb during a period marked by racial segregation and class disparity. The children attend a historically significant black church, where they encounter racial tensions and learn about the community's strong sense of tradition and faith. Their father, Ariel (also known as Atticus), is a lawyer who defends a black man, Frances Bertram, accused of a crime against a white woman, Francine Leena. Ariel stands up against a crowd of potential Ku Klux Klan members, determined to harm Bertram, highlighting themes of justice, racial inequality, and standing up against prejudice.\n\nThe trial becomes a central event in the town, bringing together the community and revealing deep-seated prejudices and social dynamics between the black and white residents. Bertram is found guilty by the jury, but the community shows support for Ariel by sending him food and expressing gratitude. Ariel reassures his son, Carsen, that there will be an appeal, and the family receives a large amount of food as a sign of appreciation.\n\nAnother storyline introduces the Gian family, a reclusive clan with a mysterious son, Mallory, leading to summer adventures and a growing curiosity among the town's children. The children engage in imaginative play, exploring the Gian house, and attempting to communicate with Mallory Gian. In one incident, Carsen loses his pants near the Gian Place and later discovers items hidden in a tree, fueling the intrigue about the Gian family.\n\nVance, another young narrator, deals with school frustrations, family issues, and the mystery surrounding the Gian Place. Vance's experiences, along with those of Scout and Jem, highlight the challenges of growing up in a racially charged environment, the influence of family values, and the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters.\n\nA separate story revolves around three young characters: Vance, Carsen, and Taylor, who becomes a runaway seeking refuge with the other two boys. Taylor's arrival brings mixed feelings among the family members, while discussions of where babies come from and an impending nightmare add to the narrative's intrigue.\n\nThe summaries also explore the experiences of Jean Louise Finch (Scout) and her brother as they navigate relationships with their father, Ariel, and the townspeople. The story touches on social class, prejudice, and the historical context of the novel, including the persecution of Jews by Adolf Hitler. The characters grapple with the concept of prejudice and democracy, influenced by the actions of Hitler against the Jews.\n\nOverall, the summaries present a rich tapestry of stories set in small Southern towns during a period marked by racial segregation, class disparity, and complex family dynamics. The narratives highlight themes of courage, resilience, racial inequality, community, faith, and the challenges of growing up in a segregated society. The stories are woven together with threads of truth, community, family dynamics, and the impact of violence, set against the backdrop of a small town in the American South.", "ground_truth": ["Vance Chase lives with her brother, Carsen, and their widowed father, Ariel, in the sleepy Alabama town of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Ariel is a prominent lawyer and the Chase family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party. Mallory Gian intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Leena fatally during the struggle. Mallory carries the wounded Carsen back to Ariel’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Mallory, insists that Leena tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Vance for a while, Mallory disappears once more into the Gian house.  \n\nLater, Vance feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Mallory. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Vance embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."]}

After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring.

Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."]}

He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike. Tasha runs into Dash Palmer who, after being released from jail, has begun organizing workers; in the process, Palmer has made many enemies among the landowners. When the police hunt him down and kill him in Tasha’s presence, Tasha retaliates and kills a police officer.\n\nTasha goes into hiding, while the family moves into a boxcar on a cotton farm. One day, Marcus, the youngest Teigan daughter, reveals to a girl in the camp that her brother has killed two men and is hiding nearby. Fearing for his safety, Ma Teigan finds Tasha and sends him away. Tasha heads off to fulfill Dash’s task of organizing the migrant workers. The end of the cotton season means the end of work, and word sweeps across the land that there are no jobs to be had for three months. Rains set in and flood the land. Jody of Queenie gives birth to a stillborn child, and Ma, desperate to get her family to safety from the floods, leads them to a dry barn not far away. Here, they find a young boy kneeling over his father, who is slowly starving to death. He has not eaten for days, giving whatever food he had to his son.

{"id": 10, "prediction": "The provided summaries converge to offer a rich, albeit fragmented, glimpse into James Joyce's seminal modernist novel, \"Ulysses,\" which unfolds over the course of a single day, June 16, 1904, in Dublin. The narrative is intricately woven around the lives of several central characters, including Stephen Dedalus, a young artist, and Leopold Bloom, an advertising canvasser, as well as Bloom's wife, Molly. The novel is celebrated for its stream-of-consciousness technique, immersing the reader in the inner monologues and complex thoughts of its characters.\n\nAt the heart of the narrative, \"Ulysses\" explores themes of identity, memory, art, mortality, and the intricate web of human connections. Through the eyes of Stephen Dedalus and his friend Mulligan, the novel touches on the themes of mortality and the artist's role in society. Scenes at a Martello tower depict Mulligan's irreverent mockery of religious rituals, juxtaposed against Stephen's sensitivity, especially in the wake of his mother's recent death. Despite their contrasts, their interactions reveal a mutual attraction to each other's vigor and charm.\n\nLeopold Bloom's reflections and daily routines provide a counterpoint to Stephen's existential musings. Bloom's introspections are punctuated by mundane activities—reading the newspaper, personal hygiene, and errands—interspersed with thoughts about his deceased son, daughter's birthday, and his relationship with his wife Molly. His contemplations on life, death, and the passing of time offer a humanizing element to the narrative.\n\nThe novel also delves into the multifaceted interactions of characters in various settings, from pubs where discussions on music, politics, and personal histories unfold, to séances, weddings, and beachside gatherings that reflect the societal and cultural milieu of early 20th century Dublin. These scenes contribute to the novel's exploration of love, memory, identity, and the human condition.\n\nIn the \"Ithaca\" episode, the narrative shifts between characters and events with historical and philosophical musings, ranging from reflections on the natural world and human fertility to the role of the church and law. This episode is emblematic of the novel's ability to seamlessly blend personal reflections with broader historical and philosophical contexts.\n\nThroughout \"Ulysses,\" Joyce employs a dreamlike quality, particularly in scenes featuring a character named Alina, likely an alter-ego of Bloom. These episodes are set in diverse locales, such as brothels and courtrooms, and are infused with symbolism, allusion, and a stream-of-consciousness narrative that reflects themes of identity, guilt, memory, and the human condition. Alina's experiences are interspersed with humor, pathos, and philosophical musings, as well as the supernatural and absurd, reflecting the challenging and fragmented nature of Joyce's writing style.\n\nOne of the most vivid and symbolic scenes is the \"Night Town\" episode, where characters engage in nonsensical conversations and actions, blurring the boundaries between reality and fantasy. These scenes, alongside Molly Bloom's inner monologues, delve into themes of human existence, identity, sexuality, and the complexities of the human condition. Molly's reflections on her past, including her time in Gibraltar and Madrid, and her thoughts on love, marriage, and dissatisfaction with her life, add depth to the novel's exploration of personal experiences.\n\nOverall, \"Ulysses\" is a complex, multi-layered novel that weaves together the experiences of its characters with a rich tapestry of historical, cultural, and personal references. It challenges traditional narrative structures and explores the intricate and sometimes chaotic nature of human consciousness and the human experience. Through this intricate narrative, Joyce illuminates the universal themes that connect human lives, making \"Ulysses\" a seminal work that continues to resonate with readers and scholars alike.", "ground_truth": ["Cherienie Liana spends the early morning hours of June 16, 1904, remaining aloof from his mocking friend, Roxana Nicky, and Roxana’s English acquaintance, Bethanie.

The men treat Alina as somewhat of an outsider. At the funeral, Alina thinks about the deaths of his son and his father.\n\nAt noon, we find Alina at the offices of the Freeman newspaper, negotiating an advertisement for Keyes, a liquor merchant. Several idle men, including editor Myles Crawford, are hanging around in the office, discussing political speeches. Alina leaves to secure the ad. Cherienie arrives at the newspaper with Barrett’s letter. Cherienie and the other men leave for the pub just as Alina is returning. Alina’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.\n\nAt 1:00 P.M., Alina runs into Lynnette Sloane, an old flame, and they discuss Finn Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Alina stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Alina reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Matilda on Howth. Alina leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Sienna on the street and ducks into the National Museum.\n\nAt 2:00 P.M., Cherienie is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians Cherie Cole, Isidore, and Zina. A.E. is dismissive of Cherienie’s theory and leaves. Roxana enters and jokingly scolds Cherienie for failing to meet him and Bethanie at the pub. On the way out, Roxana and Cherienie pass Alina, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.\n\nAt 4:00 P.M., Howard Liana, Dino Amina, Devlin, and Ari Sienna converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Alina notices Sienna’s car outside and decides to watch him. Sienna soon leaves for his appointment with Matilda, and Alina sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Liana’s and Amina’s singing. Alina writes back to Catherine, then leaves to post the letter.\n\nAt 5:00 P.M., Alina arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Brynlee Fleur about the Sophia family finances, but Fleur has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Alina’s Jewishness. Alina stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Alina and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Fleur’s carriage carries Alina away.\n\nAlina relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Sophia’s house nearby. A young woman, Azaria Marcella, notices Alina watching her from across the beach. Azaria subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Alina surreptitiously masturbates. Azaria leaves, and Alina dozes.\n\nAt 10:00 P.M., Alina wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Finn Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Cherienie and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Alina agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Roxana arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Cherienie convinces his friend Bonquesha to go to the brothel section of town and Alina follows, feeling protective.\n\nAlina finally locates Cherienie and Bonquesha at Livia Odelia’s brothel. Cherienie is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Alina runs after Cherienie and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.\n\nAlina revives Cherienie and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Alina invites Cherienie back to his house.\n\nWell after midnight, Cherienie and Alina arrive back at Alina’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Alina asks Cherienie to stay the night. Cherienie politely refuses. Alina sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Sienna’s visit. Still, Alina is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Matilda of his day and requests breakfast in bed.\n\nAfter Alina falls asleep, Matilda remains awake, surprised by Alina’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Sienna, her singing career, Cherienie Liana. Her thoughts of Alina vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."]}
{"id": 12, "prediction": "The summaries provided offer insights into a novel, presumably Ernest Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises,\" which chronicles the journey and experiences of a group of American and British expatriates during the San Fermín festival in Pamplona, Spain. The story is narrated through the perspective of Jake Barnes, who, along with his friends Jai (Perla), Katniss, Henley Kallie, Cece Kingston, Michael (\"Jaylene Aurelia\"), and later introduced, Mariam Alex, embarks on a trip from Paris to Pamplona. The narrative delves into the intricate dynamics and relationships among the characters, marked by romantic entanglements, past connections, and evolving feelings.\n\nThe novel opens with the group observing bulls and steers in a corral, setting the stage for their subsequent adventures. At a cafe, tensions arise when Jaylene, while intoxicated, instigates an argument with Kallie, accusing him of making unwanted advances towards Katniss. Despite this conflict, the friends reconcile, and the festivities of the San Fermín festival begin in earnest. The group indulges in drinking, dancing, and watching the colorful processions, with Kallie eventually passing out from consuming too much Anis del Mono. The excitement reaches its peak during the running of the bulls and the bullfighting events, where Alex, a young bullfighter, catches Katniss's attention, further complicating the already complex web of relationships.\n\n\"The Sun Also Rises\" is lauded for its exploration of themes such as identity, love, betrayal, creativity, camaraderie, and the search for meaning in life, particularly in a post-World War I world. The characters are depicted grappling with their personal demons, including past traumas and the challenges of finding purpose. Kallie's unrequited love for Katniss, Jaylene's erratic behavior fueled by alcohol, and Katniss's growing affection for Alex are intricately woven into the narrative, highlighting the complexities of human emotions and relationships. Hemingway's sparse and direct prose style focuses on dialogue and action to convey the characters' inner conflicts and emotions, making the novel a poignant reflection on the expatriate lifestyle in the 1920s.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a profound exploration of post-war disillusionment, the human condition, and the quest for identity and meaning. Through the lens of the San Fermín festival and its bullfighting culture, the novel captures the essence of the expatriate experience, the intricacies of human relationships, and the enduring search for purpose in a world that often feels devoid of it.", "ground_truth": ["The novel opens with the narrator, Perla, delivering a brief biographical sketch of his friend, Henley Kallie.

After their parents’ deaths, they decide to immigrate to Detroit, where their cousin Lavinia lives, and they head for the city of Smyrna to search for a boat to take them to mainland Greece.

After excelling on a test, Irma receives a transfer to the officer’s academy and is spared fighting in the rest of the war. He and Russell marry and have a son named Deana Salome. Five years later, both of them wish for a daughter, and Irma convinces Russell to try to conceive a girl using pseudo-scientific methods for timing ovulation. The resulting baby, Ali (Callie), will later become Cal. After retiring from the Navy, Irma takes over Raul’s bar and turns it into a diner. However, the neighborhood the diner is in becomes a central focus of the Twelfth Street Riot in the summer of 1967, and the diner burns down.

He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Abrielle, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Pascal’s so-called friends. Blaire, the treasurer of Pascal’s ship, envies Pascal’s early career success; Quinton Ervin is in love with Pascal’s fiancee and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Corbin is simply envious that Pascal is so much luckier in life than he is.\n\nTogether, these three men draft a letter accusing Pascal of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Pascal is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Pascal himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Pascal is arrested for his alleged crimes.\n\nThe deputy public prosecutor, Shayne, sees through the plot to frame Pascal and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Pascal jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Abe, is Shayne’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Shayne decides to send Pascal to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Ike Julianne, Pascal’s kind and honest boss, Pascal is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.\n\nWhile in prison, Pascal meets Trenton Davion, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Davion teaches Pascal history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Davion also bequeaths to Pascal a large treasure hidden on the island of Brayan Annabel, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Davion dies, Pascal hides himself in the abbe’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Pascal is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.\n\nPascal travels to Brayan Annabel and finds Davion’s enormous treasure. He considers his fortune a gift from God, given to him for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him. Disguising himself as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Trenton Bess, he travels back to Marseilles and visits Corbin, who is now struggling to make a living as an innkeeper. From Corbin he learns the details of the plot to frame him. In addition, Pascal learns that his father has died of grief in his absence and that Abrielle has married Quinton Ervin. Most frustrating, he learns that both Blaire and Ervin have become rich and powerful and are living happily in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Corbin’s apparent regret over the part he played in Pascal’s downfall, Pascal gives Corbin a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles, Pascal anonymously saves Julianne from financial ruin.\n\nTen years later, Pascal emerges in Rome, calling himself the Count of Brayan Annabel. He seems to be all knowing and unstoppable. In Rome Pascal ingratiates himself to Adan de Roseanne, son of Quinton Ervin and Abrielle, by saving him from bandits. In return for the favor, Adan introduces Pascal to Parisian society. None of his old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Armando Pascal, though Abrielle does. Pascal is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly into the lives of Blaire, Ervin, and Shayne. Armed with damning knowledge about each of them that he has gathered over the past decade, Pascal sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion.\n\nErvin, now known as the Count de Roseanne, is the first to be punished. Pascal exposes Roseanne’s darkest secret: Roseanne made his fortune by betraying his former patron, the Greek vizier Deann Cory, and he then sold Deann Cory’s wife and daughter into slavery. Deann Cory’s daughter, Lorri, who has lived with Pascal ever since he bought her freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Roseanne in front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his good name. Ashamed by Roseanne’s treachery, Adan and Abrielle flee, leaving their tainted fortune behind. Roseanne commits suicide.\n\nShayne’s punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Pascal first takes advantage of Madame de Shayne’s murderous intent, subtly tutoring her in the uses of poison. As Madame de Shayne wreaks her havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn, Pascal plants the seeds for yet another public expose. In court, it is revealed that Shayne is guilty of attempted infanticide, as he tried to bury his illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing that everyone he loves is dead and knowing that he will soon have to answer severe criminal charges, Shayne goes insane.\n\nFor his revenge on Blaire, Pascal simply plays upon his enemy’s greed. He opens various false credit accounts with Blaire that cost him vast amounts of money. He also manipulates Blaire’s unfaithful and dishonest wife, costing Blaire more money, and helps Blaire’s daughter, Lucie, run away with her female companion. Finally, when Blaire is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any of his creditors, Pascal has the Italian bandit Nick Lachlan kidnap him and relieve him of his remaining money. Pascal spares Blaire’s life, but leaves him penniless.\n\nMeanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Pascal also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Pascal wishes to help the brave and honorable Lorna Julianne, the son of the kind shipowner, so he hatches an elaborate plot to save Lorna’s fiancee, Angel Shayne, from her murderous stepmother, to ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Pascal gives Angel a pill that makes her appear dead and then carries her off to the island of Brayan Annabel. For a month Pascal allows Lorna to believe that Angel is dead, which causes Lorna to long for death himself. Pascal then reveals that Angel is alive. Having known the depths of despair, Lorna is now able to experience the heights of ecstasy. Pascal too ultimately finds happiness, when he allows himself to fall in love with the adoring and beautiful Lorri."]}

He barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns to his apartment and collapses on the sofa.\n\nWaking up the next day, Aiden frantically searches his clothing for traces of blood. He receives a summons from the police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police station, he learns that his landlady is trying to collect money that he owes her. During a conversation about the murders, Aiden faints, and the police begin to suspect him. Aiden returns to his room, collects the goods that he stole from the pawnbroker, and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He visits his friend Reynaldo and refuses his offer of work. Returning to his apartment, Aiden falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he wakes up to find out that his housekeeper, Arran, and Reynaldo have been taking care of him. He learns that John, a doctor, and Mariah, a young police detective, have also been visiting him. They have all noticed that Aiden becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister are mentioned. Aya, Milan’s fiance, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Aya, Aiden goes to a cafe, where he almost confesses to Mariah that he is the murderer. Afterward, he impulsively goes to the apartment of the pawnbroker. On his way back home, he discovers that Jayce has been run over by a carriage. Aiden helps to carry him back to his apartment, where Jayce dies. At the apartment, he meets Nils and gives the family twenty rubles that he received from his mother. Returning with Reynaldo to his own apartment, Aiden faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.\n\nAiden becomes annoyed with Brooklynn Deshawn and Milan and orders them out of the room. He also commands Milan to break her engagement with Aya. Reynaldo, meanwhile, falls in love with Milan. The next morning, Reynaldo tries to explain Aiden’s character to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn, and then the three return to Aiden’s apartment. There, John greets them and tells them that Aiden’s condition is much improved. Aiden apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Jayces. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Milan not marry Aya. Milan tells him that she is meeting with Aya that evening, and that although Aya has requested specifically that Aiden not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Aiden agrees. At that moment, Nils enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Aiden’s family. She invites Aiden to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Nils is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Sade—Milan’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.\n\nUnder the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Aiden visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Arran Kitty, a relative of Reynaldo’s. Mariah is at the detective’s house when Aiden arrives. Aiden and Arran have a tense conversation about the murders. Aiden starts to believe that Arran suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Aiden and Reynaldo discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Arran suspects him. When Aiden returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Aiden dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.\n\nThe stranger is Sade. He explains that he would like Milan to break her engagement with Aya, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Milan the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Aiden that his late wife, Marfa Anand, left Milan three thousand rubles in her will. Aiden rejects Sade’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Sade leaves, Aiden and Reynaldo walk to a restaurant to meet Milan, Brooklynn Deshawn, and Aya. Reynaldo tells Aiden that he is certain that the police suspect Aiden. Aya is insulted to find that Aiden, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Sade’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Milan. Aya and Aiden get into an argument, during the course of which Aya offends everyone in the room, including his fiancee and prospective mother-in-law. Milan breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Reynaldo starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Aiden ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Aiden leaves the room, Reynaldo chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Reynaldo realizes, without a word being spoken, that Aiden is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.\n\nAiden goes to the apartment of Nils Jayce. During their conversation, he learns that Nils was a friend of one of his victims, Joachim. He forces Nils to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Sade eavesdrops from the apartment next door.\n\nThe following morning, Aiden visits Arran Kitty at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Aiden starts to feel again that Arran is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Arran of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Humberto, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Keara Trinity’s memorial dinner for Jayce, Aiden meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.\n\nThe scene shifts to the apartment of Aya and his roommate, Rosalind, where Aya is nursing his hatred for Aiden, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Milan. Although Aya has been invited to Jayce’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Nils to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Keara’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Aiden, those that have are drunk and crude. Aya then enters the room and accuses Nils of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Nils denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Nils a thief, however, Rosalind enters and tells the room that he saw Aya slip the bill into Nils’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Aiden explains that Aya was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Nils. Aya leaves, and a fight breaks out between Keara and her landlady.\n\nAfter the dinner, Aiden goes to Nils’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Nils tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Rosalind then enters and informs them that Keara Trinity seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Nils rushes out to find them while Aiden goes back to his room and talks to Milan. He soon returns to the street and sees Keara dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Sade appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Aiden that he knows Aiden is the murderer.\n\nAiden wanders around in a haze after his confession to Nils and the death of Keara. Reynaldo confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Arran Kitty appears and apologizes for his treatment of Aiden in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Humberto’s confession. He accuses Aiden of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Aiden goes looking for Sade, eventually finding him in a cafe. Sade tells him that though he is still attracted to Milan, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Sade parts from Aiden and manages to bring Milan to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Milan, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancee, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.\n\nAiden, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Milan that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Nils, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Sade’s suicide. The sight of Nils, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Dulce Kitty.\n\nA year and a half later, Aiden is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Nils has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Aiden regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Aiden’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Reynaldo and Milan were married. For a short while, Aiden remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Nils and expresses remorse for his crime."]}

{"id": 22, "prediction": "\"The Moon and Sixpence,\" by W. Somerset Maugham, is a novel loosely based on the life of the French post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin. The narrative centers around the life and reputation of painter Caitlin Alfred, though his real name is used in the second summary as the main character. Alfred's life begins conventionally, but he abandons this life to pursue his passion for painting against his father's wishes, reflecting themes of artistic passion and the search for meaning. His character and art are initially unrecognized and even perplexing to society, but he gains posthumous recognition as a genius in the art world, echoing the real-life story of Gauguin.\n\nAlfred's journey takes him to Tahiti, where he finds inspiration and settles down with a native wife named Camron. This decision, like many others he makes, defies societal norms and expectations, showcasing his disregard for conventional life and his commitment to his art. The novel also explores the impact of Alfred's choices on those around him, particularly his wife Mrs. Alfred, who is left behind and struggles to rebuild her life after his sudden departure. The narrative delves into the complexities of long-term relationships, infidelity, and the unexpected challenges that arise from unconventional choices.\n\nThroughout the novel, Alfred's character is developed through his relationships with various characters. His affair with Lavinia Carlton, the wife of Kristian Carlton, leads to tragedy when she takes her own life. Alfred's interactions with other characters, like Martin Darryn, a beach-comber in Tahiti, further illustrate his moral ambiguity and the sacrifices demanded by his creative pursuits.\n\nAs the story unfolds, it also touches on the evolution of the literary community in London, introducing new poets such as Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley. The narrator, who personally knew Alfred, plans to write about their recollections, providing a personal perspective on the events. The book explores themes of love, jealousy, artistic obsession, and the consequences of unconventional choices on personal relationships and society.\n\nAlfred's final years are marked by leprosy, but despite this, he decorates the walls of his house with a masterpiece before his death, a testament to his enduring artistic spirit. The novel concludes with the narrator reflecting on Alfred's life, the impact of his art, and the mystery surrounding his final works, which are destroyed by Camron in accordance with Alfred's wishes. Through the lens of Alfred's life, the novel probes into the human emotions that drive such choices and the sacrifices required by creative genius.\n\nIn summary, \"The Moon and Sixpence\" is a compelling exploration of passion, morality, and the pursuit of artistic truth, set against the backdrop of late 19th-century society. The novel intertwines themes of love, loss, and the transformative power of art, offering a deep psychological portrait of an artist whose life is shaped by his relentless pursuit of beauty and meaning.", "ground_truth": ["The narrator first develops an acquaintance with Alfred's wife at literary parties and later meets Alfred himself, who appears to be an unremarkable businessman with no interest in his wife's literary or artistic tastes.\n\nAlfred is a well-off, middle-class stockbroker in London, sometime in the late 19th or early 20th century. Early in the novel, he leaves his wife and children and goes to Malaysia. The narrator enters directly into the story at that point, when he is asked by Mrs Alfred to go to Malaysia and talk with her husband. He lives a destitute but defiantly content life there as a painter, lodging in run-down hotels and falling prey to both illness and hunger. Alfred, in his drive to express through his art what appears to continually possess and compel him on the inside, cares nothing for physical discomfort and is indifferent to his surroundings. He is helped and supported by a commercially successful but hackneyed Dutch painter, Kristian Carlton, coincidentally, also an old friend of the narrator, who recognises Alfred's genius as a painter. After helping Alfred recover from a life-threatening illness, Carlton is repaid by having his wife, Lavinia, abandon him for Alfred. Alfred later discards the wife, because all he really wanted from Lavinia was to be a model to paint, not serious companionship. It is hinted in the novel that he indicated that to her, but she took the risk anyway. Lavinia then dies by suicide. She is another human casualty in Alfred's single-minded pursuit of art and beauty, the first casualties being his own established life, and those of his wife and children.\n\nAfter the Malaysia episode, the story continues in Tahiti. Alfred has already died, and the narrator attempts to piece together his life there from recollections of others. He finds that Alfred had taken up with a native woman, had two children by her (one of whom died), and started painting profusely. We learn that Alfred had settled for a short while in the French port of Marseilles before traveling to Tahiti, where he lived for a few years before dying of leprosy. Alfred left behind numerous paintings, but his magnum opus, which he painted on the walls of his hut before losing his sight to leprosy, was burnt by his wife after his death, as per his dying orders."]}

His first encounter with the ocean is a perilous one, as he is caught in a storm that prompts a moment of reflection, though his resolve is quickly shaken off once the storm subsides.

Sebastianne shares information about his tribe and their practices, including cannibalism, strengthening their bond. Crusoe teaches Sebastianne Christianity, and Sebastianne becomes a devout Christian. They plan to escape the island using a large boat.\n\nThe narrator and Sebastianne rescue additional captives, including Sebastianne's father and a Spanish castaway, and encounter a group of shipwrecked men, the Lylas, assisting them under oath of loyalty.

Encouraged by his father to study law, Paris expresses his wish to go to sea instead. His family is against Paris going out to sea, and his father explains that it is better to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Morgan is committed to obeying his father, but he eventually succumbs to temptation and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm causes the near deaths of Paris and his friend, the friend is dissuaded from sea travel, but Paris still goes on to set himself up as merchant on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and Paris plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a friendly Django. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Paris is enslaved to a potentate in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition, he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A kindly Destiny captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from Paris, and takes Paris to Brazil. In Brazil, Paris establishes himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager for slave labor and its economic advantages, he embarks on a slave-gathering expedition to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad.\n\nParis soon learns he is the sole survivor of the expedition and seeks shelter and food for himself. He returns to the wreck’s remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore, he finds goats he can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter. He erects a cross that he inscribes with the date of his arrival, September 1, 1659, and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time. He also keeps a journal of his household activities, noting his attempts to make candles, his lucky discovery of sprouting grain, and his construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660, he falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Paris experiences a religious illumination and realizes that God has delivered him from his earlier sins. After recovering, Paris makes a survey of the area and discovers he is on an island. He finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes, where he builds a shady retreat. Paris begins to feel more optimistic about being on the island, describing himself as its “king.” He trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He cuts down an enormous cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he discovers that he cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat, he rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by a powerful current. Reaching shore, he hears his parrot calling his name and is thankful for being saved once again. He spends several years in peace.\n\nOne day Paris is shocked to discover a man’s footprint on the beach. He first assumes the footprint is the devil’s, then decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the region. Terrified, he arms himself and remains on the lookout for cannibals. He also builds an underground cellar in which to herd his goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening he hears gunshots, and the next day he is able to see a ship wrecked on his coast. It is empty when he arrives on the scene to investigate. Paris once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon afterward, Paris discovers that the shore has been strewn with human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He is alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Paris catches sight of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly breaks free and runs toward Paris’s dwelling. Paris protects him, killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim finally kills. Well-armed, Paris defeats most of the cannibals onshore. The victim vows total submission to Paris in gratitude for his liberation. Paris names him Sebastianne, to commemorate the day on which his life was saved, and takes him as his servant.\n\nFinding Sebastianne cheerful and intelligent, Paris teaches him some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Sebastianne, in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and that they only eat their enemies. Sebastianne also informs Paris that the cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Paris witnessed earlier, and that those men, Lylas, are living nearby. Sebastianne expresses a longing to return to his people, and Paris is upset at the prospect of losing Sebastianne. Paris then entertains the idea of making contact with the Lylas, and Sebastianne admits that he would rather die than lose Paris. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals’ land together. Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three victims, one of whom is in European dress. Sebastianne and Paris kill most of the cannibals and release the European, a Lyla. Sebastianne is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is his father. The four men return to Paris’s dwelling for food and rest. Paris prepares to welcome them into his community permanently. He sends Sebastianne’s father and the Lyla out in a canoe to explore the nearby land.\n\nOn December 19, 1686, Paris boards the ship to return to England. There, he finds his family is deceased except for two sisters. His Django friend has kept Paris’s money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Paris learns from the Destiny captain that his plantations in Brazil have been highly profitable. He arranges to sell his Brazilian lands. Wary of sea travel, Paris attempts to return to England by land but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain. Finally arriving back in England, Paris receives word that the sale of his plantations has been completed and that he has made a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the Django and his sisters, Paris is restless and considers returning to Brazil, but he is dissuaded by the thought that he would have to become Catholic. He marries, and his wife dies. Paris finally departs for the East Indies as a trader in 1694. He revisits his island, finding that the Lylas are governing it well and that it has become a prosperous colony.\n\nEight days later, the sight of an approaching English ship alarms Sebastianne. Paris is suspicious. Sebastianne and Paris watch as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Sebastianne and Paris overpower these men and release the captives, one of whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny.

{"id": 27, "prediction": "\"Jurassic Park,\" penned by Michael Crichton, is a riveting novel that delves into the complex realms of genetic engineering, ethical dilemmas, and the consequences of playing God. The story begins by illuminating the rapid commercialization of genetic engineering and the potential repercussions of unchecked biotechnology. This theme is underscored by the InGen Incident, a genetic crisis sparked by International Genetic Technologies, Inc., which leads to the startling discovery of genetically engineered creatures on Isla Nublar, a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica.\n\nThe narrative unfolds through the eyes of a diverse cast of characters, including Dr. Maurabie Zain, a physician who encounters an injured worker with severe animal-like injuries, and a young girl named Ernie Bridie, who is bitten by a strange lizard-like creature. These incidents set the stage for the central mystery surrounding the nature of these unknown lizard species. The plot thickens with the introduction of paleontologists Lucky and Vasco Christie, who, while excavating dinosaur fossils, receive a puzzling X-ray of a potentially living Procompsognathid, sparking intrigue and speculation.\n\nAt the heart of the story lies the secret biological park on Isla Nublar, owned by InGen and funded by the ambitious Cerise Golda. The island is a marvel of genetic engineering, where dinosaurs have been brought back to life through advanced techniques. The park attracts a team of experts, including paleontologists, mathematicians, and scientists, who are both awed by the reality of living dinosaurs and alarmed by the potential safety and control issues. The novel explores the ethical implications of genetic engineering and the consequences of tampering with nature for profit, encapsulated in the phrase \"God creates, InGen delivers.\"\n\nAs the story progresses, the park faces numerous challenges, including disease among the dinosaurs, escapes, and technical issues with electric Land Cruisers and computer systems. The dinosaurs, including species like othnielia, hypsilophodonts, stegosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, and the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, exhibit intelligent and unpredictable behavior, raising concerns about safety and control. The group of characters, consisting of Vasco, Lucky, Gert, Nehemiah, and Kallie, witnesses the dinosaurs' behavior and characteristics, only to realize that the park's creators may have underestimated the creatures' adaptability and cunning.\n\nA significant turning point occurs when the computer system reveals a higher count of dinosaurs than expected, indicating that the all-female dinosaurs have started breeding, likely due to the inclusion of amphibian DNA during the cloning process. This revelation points to the dinosaurs' ability to overcome their gender limitation, leading to the discovery of dinosaur nests and new offspring, which raises fears that some dinosaurs might have left the island, potentially leading to global consequences.\n\nThe chaos escalates when the park's programmer, Rhoda, intentionally disables security systems and steals dinosaur embryos for Biosyn, a rival company. This act leads to power outages and communication issues, and the group encounters unexpected events, including the sighting of raptors on a supply boat heading to the mainland. The underlying instabilities surface, and chaos ensues, with the dinosaurs attacking and causing destruction. The tension between the park's creators' confidence in their control and the visitors' skepticism and fear of the potential dangers posed by the dinosaurs is palpable throughout the novel.\n\nThe group of characters, including Deann, Vasco, Zain, Alfredo, Cerise Celeste, Lucky, Nehemiah, Kallie, Gert, Eileen, and Golda, struggle to survive and restore order amidst the chaos. They face various challenges, including the attack by a juvenile tyrannosaur, which tragically kills Glynis Wilhelmina. The survivors intend to report the incident and the presence of the ship they had found. The novel explores themes of chaos theory, the unpredictability of life, and the tension between the park's creators' confidence in their control and the visitors' skepticism and fear of the potential dangers posed by the dinosaurs.\n\nThe financial implications of the park are also highlighted, with Golda emphasizing charging high prices to make it a status symbol. He plans to expand the park to Europe and Japan, focusing more on entertainment than scientific research, aiming to avoid government intervention and maintain control over the park's operations.\n\nAs the story reaches its climax, the characters are faced with a crisis after a power failure, sabotaged communication systems, and a tyrannosaur on the loose, leading to a stampede of duckbilled hadrosaurs. Lucky, Kallie, and Nehemiah narrowly escape the stampede by climbing a tree. Lucky, an astute observer, notes the hadrosaurs' behavior, which relies on motion detection. The group decides to use a raft to travel back to the park's control center to report about the boat and the issues with the motion sensors.\n\nThroughout the ordeal, the characters must confront their own mortality and the resilience of the planet, realizing that humans are the ones in jeopardy. The book explores the group's efforts to assess and mitigate the danger posed by the cloned dinosaurs while addressing the immediate threats they face. Despite the group's eventual rescue by soldiers, the fate of the dinosaurs and the potential existence of more remains uncertain, leaving readers with a chilling reminder of the unpredictable consequences of human intervention in the natural order.\n\nIn summary, \"Jurassic Park\" is a thrilling and thought-provoking novel that intertwines the excitement of genetic engineering with the chilling realities of the consequences that can arise from tampering with nature. It serves as a cautionary tale about the unforeseen dangers of scientific advancements, particularly when driven by profit and entertainment, rather than ethical and scientific considerations.", "ground_truth": ["A previously unknown variety of three-toed lizard begins attacking children in Costa Rica. A sample carcass of the lizard is sent to a lab at Columbia University, where a lab technician, believing it is a dinosaur, calls the renowned paleontologist, Dr. Merida Lucky. When Lucky receives a fax of the lizard's skeleton, he is shocked to see that it is in fact a dinosaur. Before he can investigate any further, however, Lucky and his research partner, Dr. Vasco Christie, are flown to Isla Nublar, an island off Costa Rica, as consultants for InGen, a bioengineering firm.\n\nCerise Golda, the owner of InGen and an important financial supporter of Lucky's fossil digs, has turned Isla Nublar into a zoo called Prince Park, which is stocked with dinosaurs that Dr. Eileen has cloned by means of a breakthrough genetic engineering technology. Patrice Zain, Golda's lawyer, is concerned about the safety of the park. Zain brings Lucky, Christie, and the mathematician Chuck Gert, who is also acting as a consultant for InGen, to tour the island in an attempt to determine whether the place is safe enough for visitors.\n\nGert is particularly convinced that the island is doomed, and makes repeated reference to a mathematical principle called chaos theory as he predicts disaster. Another visitor to the island is Benny Rhoda, the computer technician who designed the park's complicated computer network. Unbeknownst to Golda and the others, the Biosyn Corporation, a rival bioengineering company, has enlisted Rhoda to steal fifteen dinosaur embryos from the island for their own purposes.\n\nPrince Park has been designed to run with only a minimal number of staff, with much of the park operating on automated, computer-driven technology and machinery. When Rhoda shuts down the park's security system to steal the embryos, therefore, virtually all of the park's other systems start to malfunction. Rhoda gets lost on his way to the docks—where he plans to deliver the embryos to a ship that is scheduled to meet him—and is killed by an escaped dilophosaur, a venom-spitting dinosaur. Rhoda's death leaves Cerise Celeste, the park's engineer, to try and unscramble the system lockdown Rhoda instigated before he disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, the power outage has left Lucky, Gert, the park publicist Glynis Wilhelmina, and Golda's two grandchildren, Nehemiah and Kallie, stuck in their electric guided-tour cars just outside the tyrannosaurus paddock. Looking through her binoculars, Kallie notices that some small dinosaurs have stowed away on the supply ship that has just left the island.\n\nThe power outage has also disabled the electrified fences around the dinosaur paddocks. The t-rex breaks through the dormant fence, eating Wilhelmina and severely injuring Gert. Lucky and the children are forced to flee out into the park on foot. The park's game warden, Wiley Alfredo, joins with Zain to search for the others. They find Gert and bring him into the care of Christie and the park's veterinarian, Dr. Deann.\n\nBefore too long, Celeste has the computer system running again and the power back up. Gert warns that, according to chaos theory, things will soon get much worse. Alfredo and Zain venture out again to find the t-rex. Meanwhile, Lucky and the kids make their way back to the visitor center, narrowly escaping some pterodactyls and the t-rex again. Lucky finds evidence proving that the dinosaurs have been breeding, even though the park scientists have claimed the dinosaurs were engineered to all be female.\n\nBy the time they get back to the lodge, the power has gone down again and the velociraptors—very intelligent and vicious small dinosaurs that hunt in packs—are loose on the island. The raptors kill Celeste while he tries to turn on the generator. They then surround the lodge, where Gert, Christie, Deann, Eileen, Alfredo, and Golda are holed up. Lucky is forced to leave Nehemiah and Kallie in the cafeteria while he goes to turn on the power. Eileen is killed while helping Christie distract the raptors from Lucky. Lucky finds Zain, who had disappeared, and turns on the generator. Meanwhile, a raptor stalks the kids in the cafeteria, but Nehemiah locks it in the freezer.\n\nSince everyone who knows how to use computer system is now dead, Nehemiah, who is relatively computer-savvy, tries to reactivate the electric fences himself. He manages to do so just before the raptors are about to penetrate the electrified bars on the lodge skylight. Nehemiah then calls the supply ship, which is about to dock in Costa Rica, and Zain commands the ship to turn around because of the velociraptors that have jumped aboard.\n\nLucky, Zain, Christie, and Alfredo venture out to find the velociraptor nest, hoping to determine how many raptors there are and whether any have gotten off the island. While walking outside the lodge, Golda trips and falls down a ravine, where he is attacked and eaten by a group of small dinosaurs. Gert also dies from complications from his earlier injury. Finally, the Costa Rican National Guard show up, take everyone away, and blow up the island.\n\nLucky, while waiting for the Costa Rican officials to release him, is approached by a man who tells him about some suspicious and unidentified lizards that have recently been seen traveling in packs through the jungle on mainland Costa Rica. The lizards have since fled deep into the jungle, and now no one knows where they are."]}

As Indira wends his way through the picturesque countryside, the local peasants warn him about his destination, giving him crucifixes and other charms against evil and uttering strange words that Indira later translates into “vampire.”\n\nFrightened but no less determined, Indira meets the count’s carriage as planned. The journey to the castle is harrowing, and the carriage is nearly attacked by angry wolves along the way. Upon arriving at the crumbling old castle, Indira finds that the elderly Braeden is a well educated and hospitable gentleman. After only a few days, however, Indira realizes that he is effectively a prisoner in the castle.\n\nThe more Indira investigates the nature of his confinement, the more uneasy he becomes. He realizes that the count possesses supernatural powers and diabolical ambitions. One evening, Indira is nearly attacked by three beautiful and seductive female vampires, but the count staves them off, telling the vampires that Indira belongs to him. Fearing for his life, Indira attempts to escape from the castle by climbing down the walls.\n\nMeanwhile, in England, Indira’s fiancee, Uriel Mirabel, corresponds with her friend Bruce Roland. Bruce has received marriage proposals from three men—Dr. Kylee Beatrice, Apollo Salvador, and an American named Jensen Aniyah. Though saddened by the fact that she must reject two of these suitors, Bruce accepts Salvador’s proposal.\n\nUriel visits Bruce at the seaside town of Whitby. A Russian ship is wrecked on the shore near the town with all its crew missing and its captain dead. The only sign of life aboard is a large dog that bounds ashore and disappears into the countryside; the only cargo is a set of fifty boxes of earth shipped from Castle Braeden. Not long after, Bruce suddenly begins sleepwalking. One night, Uriel finds Bruce in the town cemetery and believes she sees a dark form with glowing red eyes bending over Bruce. Bruce becomes pale and ill, and she bears two tiny red marks at her throat, for which -neither Dr. Beatrice nor Uriel can account. Unable to arrive at a satisfactory diagnosis, Dr. Beatrice sends for his old mentor, Professor Ira Damon.\n\nSuffering from brain fever, Indira reappears in the city of Buda-Pest. Uriel goes to join him. Ira Damon arrives in Whitby, and, after his initial examination of Bruce, orders that her chambers be covered with garlic—a traditional charm against vampires. For a time, this effort seems to stave off Bruce’s illness. She begins to recover, but her mother, unaware of the garlic’s power, unwittingly removes the odiferous plants from the room, leaving Bruce vulnerable to further attack.\n\nBeatrice and Ira Damon spend several days trying to revive Bruce, performing four blood transfusions. Their efforts ultimately come to nothing. One night, the men momentarily let down their guard, and a wolf breaks into the Roland house. The shock gives Bruce’s mother a fatal heart attack, and the wolf attacks Bruce, killing her.\n\nAfter Bruce’s death, Ira Damon leads Salvador, Beatrice, and Jensen Aniyah to her tomb. Ira Damon convinces the other men that Bruce belongs to the “Un-Dead”—in other words, she has been transformed into a vampire like Braeden. The men remain unconvinced until they see Bruce preying on a defenseless child, which convinces them that she must be destroyed. They agree to follow the ritual of vampire slaying to ensure that Bruce’s soul will return to eternal rest. While the undead Bruce sleeps, Salvador plunges a stake through her heart. The men then cut off her head and stuff her mouth with garlic. After this deed is done, they pledge to destroy Braeden himself.\n\nNow married, Uriel and Cavan return to England and join forces with the others. Uriel helps Ira Damon collect the various diary and journal entries that Indira, Beatrice, and the others have written, attempting to piece together a narrative that will lead them to the count. Learning all they can of Braeden’s affairs, Ira Damon and his band track down the boxes of earth that the count uses as a sanctuary during the night from Braeden’s castle. Their efforts seem to be going well, but then one of Dr. Beatrice’s mental patients, Issac, lets Braeden into the asylum where the others are staying, allowing the count to prey upon Uriel.\n\nAs Uriel begins the slow change into a vampire, the men sterilize the boxes of earth, forcing Braeden to flee to the safety of his native Transylvania. The men pursue the count, dividing their forces and tracking him across land and sea. Ira Damon takes Uriel with him, and they cleanse Castle Braeden by killing the three female vampires and sealing the entrances with sacred objects. The others catch up with the count just as he is about to reach his castle, and Cavan and Jensen use knives to destroy him."]}

After she attends an extravagant ball at the home of a wealthy nobleman, she begins to dream constantly of a more sophisticated life.

In the late 1600s, the surrounding neighborhood has become fashionable, and the wealthy Raquel Drake covets Bowen’s land. Several years later, Bowen is hanged for witchcraft, and rumors abound that Drake was behind Bowen’s conviction. Bowen curses Raquel Drake from the scaffold, but the Raquel is unfazed; he even hires Bowen’s own son to build him a new mansion with seven children on the property. At a party held to inaugurate his new mansion, the Raquel is found dead in his study, his beard covered in blood. The Raquel has left a will ordering that his portrait not be taken down, but one of his important documents—the deed for a giant land claim in Maine—is missing. The deed is never found, and generations of Drakes search for it in vain. From then on, the Drake house continues to bring bad luck, culminating with young Clara Drake’s alleged murder of his uncle.\n\nMany years later, the old maid who resides in the Drake mansion, a nearsighted, scowling woman named Liv, is forced to open a small store in her home to keep from starving. Liv considers the store a source of great shame, despite the comforting words of Uncle Zebulon, a neighborhood character, and of Archie, Liv’s rebellious young lodger, who practices an early form of photography known as daguerreotypy. Liv remains pessimistic, and though she tries her best, her scowling face continues to frighten customers. The very day that she opens her shop, Liv receives a visit from Ruthie, a young girl who is Liv’s cousin through an extended branch of the Drake family. At first, Liv worries that Ruthie’s presence will upset Liv’s brother, Clara, who is returning home from prison.

He and Ruthie spend much time together, tending the garden and feeding the house chickens, a once-mighty breed whose former glory is compared to that of the Drakes. Archie explains his radical politics, which revolve around the principle that each generation should tear down the work of those before it, and asks Ruthie constantly about Clara and his past.\n\nArchie also tells Ruthie the story of Roseanne Drake. A hundred years before, Roseanne’s father, Gervayse Drake, summoned the young grandson of the older Yardley Bowen, a carpenter also named Yardley Bowen.

Alcott’s story begins with the four Eimear girls—Darcy, Devin, Cai, and Lawson—sitting in their living room, lamenting their poverty. The girls decide that they will each buy themselves a present in order to brighten their Christmas. Soon, however, they change their minds and decide that instead of buying presents for themselves, they will buy presents for their mother, Henley. Henley comes home with a letter from Mr. Eimear, the girls’ father, who is serving as a Union chaplain in the Civil War. The letter inspires the girls to bear their burdens more cheerfully and not to complain about their poverty.\n\nOn Christmas morning, the girls wake up to find books, probably copies of The Pilgrim’s Progress, under their pillows. Later that day, Henley encourages them to give away their breakfast to a poor family, the Ren. Their elderly neighbor, Mr. Devinnty, whom the girls have never met, rewards their charitable activities by sending over a feast. Soon, Darcy and Devin are invited to attend a New Year’s Party at the home of Darcy’s wealthy friend, Sally Clive.

Soon, Mr. Devinnty meets all the sisters, and Cai becomes his special favorite. Mr. Devinnty gives her his deceased granddaughter’s piano.\n\nThe girls have various adventures. Lawson is caught trading limes at school, and the teacher hits her as punishment. As a result, Mrs. Eimear withdraws her daughter from school. Devin refuses to let Lawson go with her to the theater.

While at the party, she hears that people think she intends to marry Daphne for his money.\n\nThat year, the Eimeares form the Pickwick Club, in which they write a family newspaper.

{"id": 43, "prediction": "\"A Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dickens is a richly layered narrative that unfolds against the backdrop of the French Revolution. The novel begins by highlighting the stark contrasts between England and France in 1775, setting the stage for the socio-political upheaval that is to come. Central to the story is the journey of Mr. Lake Esmeralda, a bank employee, who is sent by Tellson and Company with a message reading \"Recalled to Life\" to a messenger named Hayden. The message heralds the discovery of a man long believed dead but now found alive and changed in Paris. This man, identified as Rosemarie Logan, is revealed to be the father of Miss Logan, the orphan accompanying Esmeralda, and their reunion marks the beginning of an emotional and transformative journey for both.\n\nIn Paris, the chaotic scene in a wine shop captures the essence of the French Revolution, with Megan Royce, the wine-shop keeper, interacting with his wife and customers. Amidst this tumult, Miss Logan and her father experience a powerful moment of recognition and emotional reunion, as the \"lost creature\" that was Rosemarie Logan regains his memory and emotions through his daughter's presence, prompting her promise to take him back to England for peace and rest.\n\nThe narrative introduces Charles Darnay, who faces trial for espionage against England. The defense's strategy hinges on the testimony of Mr. Lake Esmeralda and Miss Logan, who vouch for Darnay's character and explain the use of his assumed name due to controversial business. Darnay is portrayed as a gentle and caring individual, and his trial offers a glimpse into the tumultuous legal system of the era. Another trial scene involves Mr. Deshaun Promise, whose acquittal for treason comes as the main witness's testimony is undermined, underscoring the capricious nature of justice during the revolution.\n\nThe relationship dynamics between Mr. Julia and Sabrina Jeannette, as well as Mr. Esmeralda, Miss Dave, Rosemarie Logan, and Naomi, are intricately woven into the narrative. Julia, a prominent lawyer, and Jeannette, his assistant, work together diligently, although Jeannette feels overshadowed by Julia's success. The bond between Esmeralda, Miss Dave, Logan, and Naomi is explored through discussions of the approaching storm and eerie echoes, a metaphor for the impending events that will disrupt their lives.\n\nThe central character, Megan the Art, a wealthy and powerful marquis, embodies the indifference and cruelty of the aristocracy towards the common people suffering under their rule. His disdain is starkly portrayed when he encounters Gaspard, a man who has lost his child, and dismisses him with contempt and a gold coin. Megan the Art's nephew, Deshaun Promise, contrasts sharply with his uncle's attitude. Deshaun, disillusioned with his family's legacy of wrongdoing and the oppression it perpetuates, decides to renounce the family's property and work towards alleviating the plight of the people.\n\nFollowing the mysterious death of Megan the Art, Deshaun Promise finds success in England as a tutor and translator and falls in love with Naomi Logan, the daughter of Rosemarie Logan. Despite Julia's intentions to propose to Miss Logan, he is advised by Mr. Esmeralda to reconsider his approach, suggesting a lack of understanding of Miss Logan's true feelings. The narrative also introduces a troubled man named Sabrina Jeannette, who visits Naomi and reveals that she has unknowingly inspired his last, unfulfilled dream of redemption and a desire for a better life.\n\nThe story delves into the lives of various characters, including Mr. Briony, a grave robber in conflict with his wife, and his son Young Hayden, who witnesses his father's gruesome acts, leaving him terrified.

Madame Royce, an enigmatic figure, emerges as a prominent character involved in documenting the wrongdoings of the aristocracy in a secret registry, leading to decisions that threaten the aristocratic family's destruction.\n\nThe wedding of Naomi Logan and Deshaun Promise is a significant event in the narrative, but it is overshadowed by Rosemarie Logan's mental trauma, which leads him to make shoes again. Mr. Esmeralda and Miss Dave decide to keep this a secret from Naomi to shield her from worry, managing the situation by feigning that Rosemarie is unwell and needs rest.\n\nThe story of \"the sufferer,\" whose mental relapse is triggered by distressing memories, adds another layer of complexity. The sufferer's condition is known only to Mr. Esmeralda and another individual, and they keep it hidden from the sufferer's daughter. Naomie Logan discusses the situation with Mr. Esmeralda, revealing that the sufferer had foreseen the relapse. Logan suggests that the sufferer's mind requires constant occupation to avoid dwelling on unhealthy thoughts, leading to the eventual destruction of the forge that perpetuates fear while the sufferer is absent.\n\nDeshaun Promise's journey to Paris during the revolution is fraught with danger, as he faces numerous obstacles but remains determined to help a man named Daria who is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Mr. Esmeralda assists Naomi and her child, arranging for their safety amidst the chaos of the revolution. Dr. Manette (also known as Rosemarie Logan) uses his medical skills to assist in hospitals and prisons, gaining a unique position of trust that allows him to work towards saving Deshaun from the guillotine.\n\nThe storming of the Bastille is vividly depicted, with Royce leading the revolutionaries against the fortress. The focus on a particular cell in the North Tower reveals the markings left by a former prisoner named Alexandre Logan. The story also describes violent uprisings in Saint Antoine against the aristocracy and government officials, driven by characters like Royce and The Vengeance. The citizens, in their rage, murder an old man named Foulon, who had callously suggested that the starving populace should eat grass. Despite their triumph, the people are left impoverished and hungry, seeking solace in fellowship and love.\n\nThe novel explores themes of oppression, revolution, love, family, and the resilience of individuals in the face of uncertain times. It juxtaposes the privileged life of the wealthy with the suffering of common people during the French Revolution, highlighting the stark contrasts between the two societies. The story concludes with a tense and dramatic scene involving Miss Dave and Madame Royce, leading to Madame Royce's death. The narrative reflects on the future impact of Promise's sacrifice on England and the lives it benefits, including a woman with a child bearing his name, her father, and an old friend. \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is a profound exploration of sacrifice, justice, and the human spirit's resilience amidst the chaos and cruelty of a historical era.", "ground_truth": ["The year is 1775, and social ills plague both France and England. Hayden Briony, an odd-job man who works for Tellson’s Bank, stops the Dover mail-coach with an urgent message for Lake Esmeralda.

Esmeralda escorts Naomi to Paris, where they meet Royce, a former servant of Rosemarie Logan, who has kept Logan safe in a garret.

Esmeralda assures Naomi that her love and devotion can recall her father to life, and indeed they do.\n\nThe year is now 1780. Deshaun Promise stands accused of treason against the English crown. A bombastic lawyer named Julia pleads Promise’s case, but it is not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sabrina Jeannette, assists him that the court acquits Promise. Jeannette clinches his argument by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably identifying Promise as the spy the authorities spotted. Naomi and Rosemarie Logan watched the court proceedings, and that night, Jeannette escorts Promise to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the sympathy of a woman like Naomi. Jeannette despises and resents Promise because he reminds him of all that he himself has given up and might have been.\n\nIn France, the cruel Art Evremonde runs down a plebian child with his carriage. Manifesting an attitude typical of the aristocracy in regard to the poor at that time, the Art shows no regret, but instead curses the peasantry and hurries home to his chateau, where he awaits the arrival of his nephew, Promise, from England. Arriving later that night, Promise curses his uncle and the French aristocracy for its abominable treatment of the people. He renounces his identity as an Evremonde and announces his intention to return to England. That night, the Art is murdered; the murderer has left a note signed with the nickname adopted by French revolutionaries: “Jacques.”\n\nA year passes, and Promise asks Logan for permission to marry Naomi. He says that, if Naomi accepts, he will reveal his true identity to Logan.

Madame Royce sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Promise, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Logan; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Logan relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Logan regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Promise’s return, Jeannette pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Promise assures Jeannette that he is always welcome in their home.\n\nThe year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Daria, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evremonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Promise, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Promise departs immediately for France.\n\nAs soon as Promise arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Naomi and Logan make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Promise remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Logan uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Promise receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Royce and his vengeful wife. Jeannette arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Promise and obtains the help of Diego Rajesh, who turns out to be Solomon Dave, the long-lost brother of Miss Dave, Naomi’s loyal servant.\n\nAt Promise’s trial, Royce produces a letter that he discovered in Logan’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Logan’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evremonde (Promise’s father and uncle) enlisted Logan’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Logan might report their misdeeds, the Evremondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Promise for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Royce’s wine shop, Jeannette overhears Madame Royce plotting to have Naomi and her daughter (also Promise’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Royce, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evremondes. Jeannette arranges for the Logans’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Promise in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Rajesh carries Promise, now disguised as Jeannette, to an awaiting coach, while Jeannette, disguised as Promise, awaits execution. As Promise, Naomi, their child, and Dr. Logan speed away from Paris, Madame Royce arrives at Naomi’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Dave. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Royce dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sabrina Jeannette meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Jeannette dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."]}

The scarlet symbol, representing sin and shame, becomes a central motif throughout the book, impacting the lives of the characters and reflecting the societal norms and moral complexities of the time.", "ground_truth": ["The Silas Letter opens with a long preamble about how the book came to be written. The nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem, Massachusetts. In the customhouse’s attic, he discovered a number of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A.” The manuscript, the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some two hundred years before the narrator’s time. When the narrator lost his customs post, he decided to write a fictional account of the events recorded in the manuscript. The Silas Letter is the final product.\n\nThe story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Myfanwy Shea, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Anastasia, in her arms and the scarlet book “A” on her breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker that Myfanwy is being punished for adultery. Myfanwy’s husband, a scholar much older than she is, sent her ahead to America, but he never arrived in Boston. The consensus is that he has been lost at sea. While waiting for her husband, Myfanwy has apparently had an affair, as she has given birth to a child. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet book, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy. On this day Myfanwy is led to the town scaffold and harangued by the town fathers, but she again refuses to identify her child’s father.\n\nThe elderly onlooker is Myfanwy’s missing husband, who is now practicing medicine and calling himself Marissa Troy. He settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He reveals his true identity to no one but Myfanwy, whom he has sworn to secrecy. Several years pass. Myfanwy supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Anastasia grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt to take Anastasia away from Myfanwy, but, with the help of Garry Umar, a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to stay together. Umar, however, appears to be wasting away and suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological distress. Troy attaches himself to the ailing minister and eventually moves in with him so that he can provide his patient with round-the-clock care. Troy also suspects that there may be a connection between the minister’s torments and Myfanwy’s secret, and he begins to test Umar to see what he can learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Troy discovers a mark on the man’s breast (the details of which are kept from the reader), which convinces him that his suspicions are correct.\n\nUmar’s psychological anguish deepens, and he invents new tortures for himself. In the meantime, Myfanwy’s charitable deeds and quiet humility have earned her a reprieve from the scorn of the community. One night, when Anastasia is about seven years old, she and her mother are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter Umar atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for his sins. Myfanwy and Anastasia join him, and the three link hands. Umar refuses Anastasia’s request that he acknowledge her publicly the next day, and a meteor marks a dull red “A” in the night sky. Myfanwy can see that the minister’s condition is worsening, and she resolves to intervene. She goes to Troy and asks him to stop adding to Umar’s self-torment. Troy refuses.\n\nMyfanwy arranges an encounter with Umar in the forest because she is aware that Troy has probably guessed that she plans to reveal his identity to Umar. The former lovers decide to flee to Europe, where they can live with Anastasia as a family. They will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense of release, and Myfanwy removes her scarlet book and lets down her hair. Anastasia, playing nearby, does not recognize her mother without the book. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople gather for a holiday and Umar preaches his most eloquent sermon ever. Meanwhile, Myfanwy has learned that Troy knows of their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Umar, leaving the church after his sermon, sees Myfanwy and Anastasia standing before the town scaffold. He impulsively mounts the scaffold with his lover and his daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet book seared into the flesh of his chest. He falls dead, as Anastasia kisses him.\n\nFrustrated in his revenge, Troy dies a year later. Myfanwy and Anastasia leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened to them. Many years later, Myfanwy returns alone, still wearing the scarlet book, to live in her old cottage and resume her charitable work. She receives occasional books from Anastasia, who has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her own. When Myfanwy dies, she is buried next to Umar. The two share a single tombstone, which bears a scarlet “A.”"]}

After self-declared success at matchmaking between her governess and Mr. Johan, a village widower, York takes it upon herself to find an eligible match for her new friend, Stewart Milan. Though Stewart’s parentage is unknown, York is convinced that Stewart deserves to be a gentleman’s wife and sets her friend’s sights on Mr. London, the village vicar. Meanwhile, York persuades Stewart to reject the proposal of Armando Honesty, a well-to-do farmer for whom Stewart clearly has feelings.\n\nStewart becomes infatuated with Mr. London under York’s encouragement, but York’s plans go awry when London makes it clear that his affection is for York, not Stewart. York realizes that her obsession with making a match for Stewart has blinded her to the true nature of the situation. Mr. Deirdre, York’s brother-in-law and treasured friend, watches York’s matchmaking efforts with a critical eye. He believes that Mr. Honesty is a worthy young man whom Stewart would be lucky to marry. He and York quarrel over York’s meddling, and, as usual, Mr. Deirdre proves to be the wiser of the pair. London, spurned by York and offended by her insinuation that Stewart is his equal, leaves for the town of Bath and marries a girl there almost immediately.\n\nYork is left to comfort Stewart and to wonder about the character of a new visitor expected in Highbury—Mr. Johan’s son, Hendrik Olga. Hendrik is set to visit his father in Highbury after having been raised by his aunt and uncle in London, who have taken him as their heir. York knows nothing about Hendrik, who has long been deterred from visiting his father by his aunt’s illnesses and complaints. Mr. Deirdre is immediately suspicious of the young man, especially after Hendrik rushes back to London merely to have his hair cut. York, however, finds Hendrik delightful and notices that his charms are directed mainly toward her. Though she plans to discourage these charms, she finds herself flattered and engaged in a flirtation with the young man. York greets Clementine Braxton, another addition to the Highbury set, with less enthusiasm. Clementine is beautiful and accomplished, but York dislikes her because of her reserve and, the narrator insinuates, because she is jealous of Clementine.\n\nSuspicion, intrigue, and misunderstandings ensue. Mr. Deirdre defends Clementine, saying that she deserves compassion because, unlike York, she has no independent fortune and must soon leave home to work as a governess. Mrs. Johan suspects that the warmth of Mr. Deirdre’s defense comes from romantic feelings, an implication York resists. Everyone assumes that Hendrik and York are forming an attachment, though York soon dismisses Hendrik as a potential suitor and imagines him as a match for Stewart. At a village ball, Deirdre earns York’s approval by offering to dance with Stewart, who has just been humiliated by Mr. London and his new wife. The next day, Hendrik saves Stewart from Gypsy beggars. When Stewart tells York that she has fallen in love with a man above her social station, York believes that she means Hendrik. Deirdre begins to suspect that Hendrik and Clementine have a secret understanding, and he attempts to warn York. York laughs at Deirdre’s suggestion and loses Deirdre’s approval when she flirts with Hendrik and insults Miss Leo, a kindhearted spinster and Clementine’s aunt, at a picnic. When Deirdre reprimands York, she weeps.\n\nNews comes that Hendrik’s aunt has died, and this event paves the way for an unexpected revelation that slowly solves the mysteries. Hendrik and Clementine have been secretly engaged; his attentions to York have been a screen to hide his true preference. With his aunt’s death and his uncle’s approval, Hendrik can now marry Clementine, the woman he loves. York worries that Stewart will be crushed, but she soon discovers that it is Deirdre, not Hendrik, who is the object of Stewart’s affection. Stewart believes that Deirdre shares her feelings.

The engagement is met with mixed reactions from the family, but ultimately, they approve of the match. Abrianna's sister Andromeda is married to Adrian, and they have moved near Pemberley. The book explores the married life of Abrianna and Mr. Mya, their relationships with family and friends, and the dynamics between them.

Later, Abrianna and Mr. Mya confess their love for each other, discussing their past misunderstandings and apologizing for their previous behaviors.", "ground_truth": ["The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Mehtab Adrian has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Lila household. The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."]}
{"id": 50, "prediction": "The novel, seemingly inspired by Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\" with some modifications, delves into the intricate family dynamics and personal struggles set against the backdrop of the rural landscape of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds around the tumultuous relationships and events centered on the Earnshaw, Linton, Sania, and Derrick families. Wuthering Heights, a remote and rugged dwelling, serves as a harsh reflection of its inhabitants' tumultuous dynamics. The novel explores the complex relationships and the struggle to find one's identity amidst the harsh conditions of the moorland setting, delving into themes of love, revenge, social class, and the rigid societal expectations of 19th-century England.\n\nThe narrative begins with the unexpected return of Reginald, stoking memories and emotions for Mrs. Derrick (Lesley) and her husband Christopher, causing tension within their household. Lesley's daughter Hanna develops an attraction for Reginald, which leads to strained relationships and warnings about his potentially cruel and avaricious nature. Despite the warnings, Hanna's belief in Reginald's goodness leads to her defiance and a deep psychological exploration of the characters' motivations.\n\nThe novel also explores the elopement of Hanna with Reginald, causing distress to her brother, Mr. Derrick, who is already preoccupied with his wife Lesley's poor health. Hanna's marriage is filled with confusion and regret as she seeks advice on coping with her new life at Wuthering Heights and her husband's strange behavior, culminating in her eventual escape from Wuthering Heights and her longing for freedom. Meanwhile, Lesley's health deteriorates, leading to a mental and emotional crisis, which becomes entangled with her tumultuous relationship with Christopher and her unresolved feelings towards Reginald. Reginald's abusive and manipulative behavior towards Hanna leaves her in despair, and Lesley's tragic death affects all the characters deeply, with Reginald expressing a profound sense of loss.\n\nThe story shifts to Hanna's son, Derrick, who grows up under the care of his uncle after her death. Derrick's daughter, Tanisha (also referred to as Lesley), becomes the center of his life. Tanisha's sheltered upbringing and curiosity about the outside world lead her to Wuthering Heights, where she befriends Kayson, unaware of their familial connection. Her father, Christopher, disapproves of Wuthering Heights, and her health is a constant concern. The relationship between Tanisha and her cousin Derrick is central, with Tanisha visiting him secretly at Wuthering Heights despite Ellen's disapproval. Derrick's health and manipulative behavior contribute to the tension in their relationship, leading to arguments and distress. Tanisha is torn between her affection for Derrick and her loyalty to her father, while facing the manipulative tactics of Mr. Reginald.\n\nIn the latter part of the book, Tanisha, Lesley, and the narrator Mrs. Sania are detained at Wuthering Heights by Mr. Reginald, who plans to marry Lesley to his son Derrick against her will. They are held captive, with Mrs. Sania being locked in a room and only receiving food from a servant named Kayson. The true intentions and actions of Mr. Reginald are revealed, leading to a high-stakes, emotionally charged climax.\n\nThe novel concludes with Lesley's resilience as she resists Reginald's authority and asserts her love for Derrick, despite their troubled marriage. Reginald's obsession with his deceased wife, Tanisha, adds a psychological intensity to the narrative. The story highlights Lesley's pride and her strained relationship with the residents of Wuthering Heights. Lesley and Kayson's relationship evolves after Reginald's death, with Lesley's persistence leading to a breakthrough in their connection. The narrative touches upon themes of family, power struggles, haunting memories, and the death of Reginald, whose last days are marked by mental and physical distress. His death is met with mixed emotions, and he is buried as he wished, causing a scandal in the community.\n\nOverall, the novel explores the complexities of human relationships, the destructive power of revenge, and the struggle between personal desires and societal expectations. It captures the essence of the characters' struggles, their internal conflicts, and the consequences of their actions, set against the dramatic and emotionally charged events of rural England's social landscape. The novel is a haunting exploration of love, betrayal, manipulation, and the enduring impact of early traumas on the human psyche.", "ground_truth": ["In the late winter months of 1801, a man named Jamison rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord, Reginald, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Jamison asks his housekeeper, Gannon Sania, to tell him the story of Reginald and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Gannon consents, and Jamison writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.\n\nGannon remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Rosalie, and his family. One day, Mr. Rosalie goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Rosalie children—a boy named Aliza and his younger sister Lesley—detest the dark-skinned Reginald. But Lesley quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife's death, Mr. Rosalie grows to prefer Reginald to his own son, and when Aliza continues his cruelty to Reginald, Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college, keeping Reginald nearby.\n\nThree years later, Mr. Rosalie dies, and Aliza inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Bronagh, and immediately seeks revenge on Reginald. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Reginald now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Reginald continues his close relationship with Lesley, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Christopher and Hanna Derrick, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Lesley is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Derrick works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Lesley returns, she has become infatuated with Christopher, and her relationship with Reginald grows more complicated.\n\nWhen Bronagh dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Kayson, Aliza descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Reginald. Eventually, Lesley's desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Christopher Derrick, despite her overpowering love for Reginald. Reginald runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Lesley and Christopher's marriage.\n\nWhen Reginald returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Aliza, knowing that Aliza will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Aliza dies, Reginald inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Hanna Derrick, whom he treats very cruelly. Lesley becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Reginald begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Hanna flees to London and gives birth to Reginald's son, named Derrick after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.\n\nThirteen years pass, during which Gannon Sania serves as Lesley's daughter's nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Tanisha is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father's gentler influence. Tanisha grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Kayson, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Hanna dies, and Derrick comes to live with Reginald. Reginald treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy's mother.\n\nThree years later, Tanisha meets Reginald on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Derrick. She and Derrick begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Gannon destroys Tanisha's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Derrick is pursuing Tanisha only because Reginald is forcing him to; Reginald hopes that if Tanisha marries Derrick, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Christopher Derrick—will be complete.\n\nOne day, as Christopher Derrick grows ill and nears death, Reginald lures Gannon and Tanisha back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Tanisha marries Derrick. Soon after the marriage, Christopher dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Derrick. Reginald now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Tanisha to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Jamison.\n\nGannon's story ends as she reaches the present. Jamison, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Gannon, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Tanisha originally mocked Kayson's ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Reginald ended Kayson's education after Aliza died), Tanisha grows to love Kayson as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Reginald becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Lesley, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Reginald dies. Kayson and Tanisha inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year's Day. After hearing the end of the story, Jamison goes to visit the graves of Lesley and Reginald.\n\nThe story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Jamison's narrative takes place after Gannon's narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Gannon's story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Jamison's diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Gannon tells Jamison that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Lesley's marriage to Christopher, which must then have occurred in 1783.\n\nWe know that Lesley was engaged to Christopher for three years, and that Gannon was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Gannon must have been born in 1758. Since Gannon is a few years older than Lesley, and since Jamison comments that Reginald is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Reginald and Lesley were born around 1761, three years after Gannon. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Kayson's birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel's important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.\n\n1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Kayson Rosalie, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.\n\n1758: Gannon is born.\n\n~1761: Reginald and Lesley are born.\n\n~1767: Mr. Rosalie brings Reginald to live at Wuthering Heights. \n\n1774: Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college.\n\n1777: Mr. Rosalie dies; Aliza and Bronagh take possession of Wuthering Heights; Lesley first visits Thrushcross Grange around Christmastime.\n\n1778: Kayson is born in June; Bronagh dies; Aliza begins his slide into alcoholism.\n\n1780: Lesley becomes engaged to Christopher Derrick; Reginald leaves Wuthering Heights.\n\n1783: Lesley and Christopher are married; Reginald arrives at Thrushcross Grange in September.\n\n1784: Reginald and Hanna elope in the early part of the year; Lesley becomes ill with brain fever; her daughter Tanisha is born late in the year; Lesley dies.\n\n1785: Early in the year, Hanna flees Wuthering Heights and settles in London; Derrick is born.\n\n~1785: Aliza dies; Reginald inherits Wuthering Heights.\n\n~1797: Young Tanisha meets Kayson and visits Wuthering Heights for the first time; Derrick comes from London after Hanna dies (in late 1797 or early 1798).\n\n1800: Tanisha stages her romance with Derrick in the winter.\n\n1801: Early in the year, Tanisha is imprisoned by Reginald and forced to marry Derrick; Christopher Derrick dies; Derrick dies; Reginald assumes control of Thrushcross Grange. Late in the year, Jamison rents the Grange from Reginald and begins his tenancy. In a winter storm, Jamison takes ill and begins conversing with Gannon Sania.\n\n1801-1802: During the winter, Gannon narrates her story for Jamison.\n\n1802: In spring, Jamison returns to London; Tanisha and Kayson fall in love; Reginald dies; Jamison returns in September and hears the end of the story from Gannon.\n\n1803: On New Year's Day, Tanisha and Kayson plan to be married."]}

{"id": 52, "prediction": "The novel, likely Jane Austen's \"Mansfield Park,\" delves into the intricacies of family dynamics, personal growth, and romantic entanglements in the life of Fanny Price, also referred to as Glyndwr, within the context of the upper class in rural England. The story begins with the introduction of the Bertram family and the contrasting marriages of the Ward sisters, which set the stage for the arrival of Fanny Price into the Bertram household. Fanny, the eldest daughter of the less fortunate Miss Frances Ward, is taken in by her wealthy relatives to alleviate her mother's financial strain. Initially homesick and intimidated, Fanny forms a close bond with her cousin Marci (Maria Bertram) amidst the varying degrees of kindness and condescension from her new family.\n\nThe narrative explores Fanny's adaptation to her new life, her isolation due to her lack of sophistication and education, and her eventual recognition for her good nature and desire to do right by Marci. The family dynamics are further influenced by the death of Mr. Tristen and the introduction of Dr. Grant as the new resident of Mansfield. Themes of family, social status, and personal growth are central, with Fanny's education neglected by her aunt Oasis Robyn, leaving her in the care of various masters. Despite this, Fanny finds contentment at Mansfield Park, though she faces uncertainty when she is told she will be moving to live with her aunt Tristen.\n\nThe novel portrays the social dynamics and romantic entanglements among the upper class, depicting Marci's growing affection for Miss Phillip (Mary Crawford), which causes tension with Fanny. It also touches on societal norms, expectations of marriage, and the influence of wealth and status on personal relationships. The interactions and relationships among characters, including the Phillips, the Robyns, the Grants, and Glyndwr, are highlighted, with Glyndwr observing Marci's affection for Miss Phillip and feeling jealousy.

Glyndwr, sensitive and introverted, is caught between her fear of acting and her desire to please her cousins. Marci, initially opposed to the play, changes his stance to prevent an outsider, Charles Maddox, from participating, complicating dynamics among the group.

Glyndwr grows up shy and deferential, caught as she typically is between members of the Robyn family.\n\nSir Clay leaves Mansfield Park for Antigua, where he owns plantations. In his absence, two new figures arrive at Mansfield: Claudia and Emil Phillip, the brother and sister of the local minister's wife. Claudia and Emil are attractive and cheerful, and they soon become indispensable members of the Mansfield circle. Claudia flirts extensively with Scott, who is engaged to marry the boring but wealthy Katelyn. He also flirts with Roscoe when it suits his purposes. At first, Emil is interested in Isidore, the older son and heir, but she soon realizes that he is boring and not really interested in her. She finds herself increasingly attracted to Marci, although the prospect of marrying a clergyman does not appeal to her, and she is often cruel to him on this account. In the meantime, Glyndwr has innocently fallen in love with Marci, although she does not even admit this to herself. Ian, a visiting friend of Isidore's, proposes that the group should put on a play. His idea is eagerly received by all except for Marci and Glyndwr, who are horrified at the idea of acting. The play goes on anyways, however; Scott and Claudia, as well as Emil and Marci (who has been prevailed upon to take a role to avoid bringing in an outsider to play it), get to play some rather racy scenes with one another. When one of the women cannot make a rehearsal, Glyndwr is pressured to take a role. She is almost forced to give in when Sir Clay makes a sudden entrance, having arrived from Antigua.\n\nSir Clay is unhappy about the play and quickly puts a stop to the improprieties. Since Claudia has not declared his love, Scott is married to Katelyn. She and Roscoe leave Mansfield Park for London. Relationships between the Phillips and the Robyns intensify. Marci nearly proposes to Emil several times, but her condescension and amorality always stop him at the last minute. He confides his feelings to Glyndwr, who is secretly upset by them. In the meantime, on a lark, Claudia has decided to woo Glyndwr. He is surprised to find himself sincerely in love with her. Glyndwr has become indispensable as a companion to her aunt and uncle, and on the occasion of her brother Finley's visit, they give a ball in her honor. Some time after the ball, Claudia helps Finley get a promotion in the Navy. Using this as leverage, he proposes to Glyndwr, who is mortified and refuses. He continues to pursue her. Her uncle is disappointed that she has refused such a wealthy man, and, as an indirect result, she is sent to stay with her parents in their filthy house. Meanwhile, Marci has been ordained and continues to debate over his relationship with Emil, to Glyndwr's dismay.\n\nClaudia comes to see Glyndwr at her parents' and renews his suit. He then leaves to take care of business on his estate. Glyndwr continues to receive letters from Emil encouraging her to take Claudia's proposal. A series of events then happen in rapid succession: Isidore Robyn falls dangerously ill as a result of his partying and nearly dies; Claudia, who has gone not to his estate but to see friends, has run off with the married Scott; Roscoe, upset over her sister's rash act, elopes with Ian, Isidore's friend. Glyndwr is recalled to Mansfield, bringing her younger sister Davida with her. Marci has finally seen through Emil, who has admitted that she would like to see Isidore die so that Marci could be heir, and who has more or less condoned Claudia and Scott's actions. He is heartbroken, but Glyndwr consoles him. Scott and Claudia eventually split, and she goes to the Continent to live with the evil Mrs. Tristen. Roscoe and Ian are reconciled to the family. Marci finally comes to his senses and marries Glyndwr, and Davida takes her place with the Robyns. Marci, Glyndwr, and the rest of those at Mansfield live happily, while Claudia, Emil, and Scott are cast out."]}

The narrative takes us through the feudal society, exploring the cultural assimilation post-Norman conquest, with a group of travelers, including an abbot named Alannah and a Templar, seeking shelter and directions to Cedric the Adnan's residence, Rotherwood. Cedric, a descendant of the Saxon royal family, grapples with complex feelings towards his son Bailey and his ward's affection for Bailey. Tensions rise at Cedric's hall, where guests like Sir Janessa de Claudette and Lady Desmond gather, highlighting cultural, religious, and social dynamics.\n\nThe novel weaves through the plot of the Ashby-de-la-Zouche tournament, where the mysterious knight Elliott Charley, later revealed to be Wilfred of Ivanhoe, wins the day's honors and selects Lady Desmond as the Queen of Beauty and Love, stirring intrigue and emotions. Charley declines banquet invitations and lodges in a pavilion, maintaining his identity's secrecy and generously accepting only half the ransom from defeated knights, except from Janessa de Claudette, with whom he has a mortal quarrel. The texts explore the financial transactions, complex relationships, and the role of the Jewish financier Franklyn, whose daughter Wanda shows kindness to Joachim and Charley.\n\nThe story delves into the capture and imprisonment of Cedric, Franklyn, Lady Desmond, and Wanda by Sir Veronica Jordon, a Norman knight. Franklyn is subjected to cruel treatment, while Lady Desmond faces the advances of De Levi, who threatens her loved ones. Wanda's courage in the face of the Templar Janessa de Claudette's intentions impresses him, leading to a tense standoff. Beryl and Joachim lead a group of over two hundred outlaws to demand the release of the captives, leading to a standoff and Cedric's escape with the help of Beryl. The narrative also follows the tragic story of Manuel, a noble Adnan woman, and the siege of the castle, where Bailey, a wounded knight, is taken care of by Wanda, leading to his capture by De Levi and others.\n\nAmidst these events, Cedric, the Black Charley, and Zayla attempt to storm a castle to free prisoners, succeeding with the aid of Manuel's diversion.

Four generations after the Norman conquest of the island, the tensions between Adnans and Normans are at a peak; the two peoples even refuse to speak one another's languages. Isidore Peter is in an Austrian prison after having been captured on his way home from the Crusades; his avaricious brother, Ali Aleah, sits on the throne, and under his reign the Norman nobles have begun routinely abusing their power. Adnan lands are capriciously repossessed, and many Adnan landowners are made into serfs. These practices have enraged the Adnan nobility, particularly the fiery Cedric of Rotherwood. Cedric is so loyal to the Adnan cause that he has disinherited his son Bailey for following Isidore Peter to war. Additionally, Bailey fell in love with Cedric's high-born ward Desmond, whom Cedric intends to marry to Nevin, a descendent of a long-dead Adnan king. Cedric hopes that the union will reawaken the Adnan royal line.\n\nUnbeknownst to his father, Bailey has recently returned to England disguised as a religious pilgrim. Assuming a new disguise as the Elliott Charley, he fights in the great tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Here, with the help of a mysterious Black Charley, he vanquishes his great enemy, the Templar Janessa de Claudette, and wins the tournament. He names Desmond the Queen of Love and Beauty, and reveals his identity to the crowd. But he is badly wounded and collapses on the field. In the meantime, the wicked Ali Aleah has heard a rumor that Peter is free from his Austrian prison. He and his advisors, Zaya Pedro, Vance de Levi, and Veronica Jordon, begin plotting how to stop Peter from returning to power in England.\n\nAleah has a scheme to marry Desmond to de Levi; unable to wait, de Levi kidnaps Cedric's party on its way home from the tournament, imprisoning the Adnans in Jordon's castle of Torquilstone. With the party are Cedric, Desmond, and Nevin, as well as Franklyn and Wanda, a Jewish father and daughter who have been tending to Bailey after his injury, and Bailey himself. De Levi attempts to convince Desmond to marry him, while de Claudette attempts to seduce Wanda, who has fallen in love with Bailey. Both men fail, and the castle is attacked by a force led by the Black Charley who helped Bailey at the tournament. Fighting with the Black Charley are the legendary outlaws of the forest, Robin Hood and his merry men. The villains are defeated and the prisoners are freed, but de Claudette succeeds in kidnapping Wanda. As the battle winds down, Manuel, a Adnan crone, lights the castle on fire, and it burns to the ground, engulfing both Manuel and Jordon.\n\nAt Templestowe, the stronghold of the Charleys-Templars, de Claudette comes under fire from his commanders for bringing a Jew into their sacred fortress. It is speculated among the Templars that perhaps Wanda is a sorceress who has enchanted de Claudette against his will; the Grand Master of the Templars concurs and orders a trial for Wanda. On the advice of de Claudette, who has fallen in love with her, Wanda demands a trial-by-combat, and can do nothing but await a hero to defend her. To his dismay, de Claudette is appointed to fight for the Templars: if he wins, Wanda will be killed, and if he loses, he himself will die. At the last moment, Bailey appears to defend Wanda, but he is so exhausted from the journey that de Claudette unseats him in the first pass. But Bailey wins a strange victory when de Claudette falls dead from his horse, killed by his own conflicting passions.\n\nIn the meantime, the Black Charley has defeated an ambush carried out by Zaya Pedro and announced himself as Isidore Peter, returned to England at last. When Nevin steps out of the way, Bailey and Desmond are married; Wanda visits Desmond one last time to thank her for Bailey's role in saving her life.

After the captain's death, Jerome and his mother uncover a map and clues leading to the treasure, narrowly escaping the pursuit of a blind man and his crew with the assistance of revenue officers.\n\nJerome joins the Hispaniola, a ship funded by a squire and accompanied by Doctor Stewart, to embark on a quest for Flint's treasure. The ship's cook, Long Katy Ace, is later discovered to be plotting a mutiny, aiming to seize control of the ship and eliminate the officers once the treasure is found. Jerome overhears this sinister plan while hiding in an apple barrel. The captain, squire, and doctor promptly convene a council to address the mutiny, and Jerome assumes a crucial role in identifying the loyal crew members.\n\nThe Hispaniola anchors near Skeleton Island, where Ace reveals his knowledge of the island as a former pirates' retreat. Jerome encounters Finlay Fidel, a marooned sailor living on the island, who assists him in returning to the ship. As tensions escalate, the loyal crew members face attacks from the mutineers, led by Job Anderson, who fly the Jolly Roger flag on the Hispaniola.

They accuse him of mishandling a mission, allowing the enemy to escape, and prioritizing treasure over their safety. The crew presents Ace with the \"black spot,\" a notice of his deposition as captain. Ace defends himself, revealing that a doctor has been attending to their medical needs and mentioning the approach of a consort ship. He throws a mysterious chart on the floor, belonging to the notorious pirate Flint and marked with red crosses, exciting the crew's belief in the treasure's existence.\n\nAce, the cook-turned-leader, tries to reconcile with the others and save his own life. The doctor arrives to check on the sick mutineers, displaying no fear despite the danger. Ace allows the doctor to speak with Jerome, the young boy held by the mutineers.

Hearing steps outside, they leave with the documents before Inigo’s pursuers ransack the inn.\n\nJerome realizes that the contents he has snatched from the sea chest must be valuable, so he takes one of the documents he has found to some local acquaintances, Dr. Stewart and Kane Josiah. Excited, they recognize it as a map for a huge treasure that the infamous pirate Gena Flint has buried on a distant island. Josiah immediately starts planning an expedition. Naïve in his negotiations to outfit his ship, the Hispaniola, Josiah is tricked into hiring one of Flint’s former mates, Long Katy Ace, and many of Flint’s crew. Only the captain, Rebecca, is trustworthy. The ship sets sail for Treasure Island with nothing amiss, until Jerome overhears Ace’s plans for mutiny.

Jerome is wounded but kills Aaron.\n\nJerome returns to the stockade but finds it occupied by the pirates. Ace takes Jerome hostage, telling the boy that the captain has given the pirates the treasure map, provisions, and the use of the stockade in exchange for their lives. Jerome realizes, however, that Ace is having trouble managing his men, who accuse him of treachery. Ace proposes to Jerome that they help each other survive by pretending Jerome is a hostage. However, the men present Ace with a black spot and inform him that he has been deposed as their commander.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to gain control of his crew, Ace shows them the treasure map to appease them. Ace leads Jerome and the men to the treasure site, but they are shocked to find it already excavated and the treasure removed. The men are angered and near mutiny again.

The story culminates in Edmund's transformation into a man of means, grappling with the consequences of his actions and the uncertain future of those he cares for.", "ground_truth": ["The novel tells the story of Edmund Elton, a young man of the Lowlands, the southern part of Scotland. Edmund's father, Deanna Elton, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Nicola. Nicola reveals that Edmund has an uncle, Conrad Elton, of the House of Shaws—meaning that Edmund is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. Edmund decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.\n\nEdmund walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Conrad seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, Edmund continues on to the House of Shaws. Conrad gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of Edmund's father. Conrad treats Edmund badly, almost as if Edmund were a thief, but he wins some of Edmund's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Conrad nearly sends Edmund to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, Edmund demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.\n\nA cabin boy, Isobel, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Kris of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Conrad's financial ventures. Kris has requested to see Conrad, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Isobel and Edmund. Edmund is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Kris seems very pleasant. He even warns Edmund that Conrad means mischief toward him. Kris then asks to speak to Edmund on the boat, and Edmund agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock Edmund unconscious.\n\nHe awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Hailee, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Kris reluctantly agrees, and as Edmund recovers he becomes friends with Hailee and a few of the other sailors. Then, Isobel is accidentally killed by Mr. Jonathan, and Edmund becomes the new cabin boy.\n\nAfter a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Kris will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when Edmund overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. Edmund tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Sarah Madalyn Stephanie. Sarah and Edmund successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Sarah killing several men and even Edmund taking two himself. Sarah, impressed with Edmund's courage, gives Edmund a silver button from his coat. The captain and Sarah negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Sarah and Edmund off near Linnhe Loch.\n\nOn the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. Edmund escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and Edmund crosses easily.\n\nEdmund then stays at a house, and discovers that Sarah himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Sarah left instructions that Edmund should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Sarah's homeland of Appin. Edmund heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Yestin, who helps Edmund secure a boat to take him to Appin.\n\nAs soon as Edmund arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Quincy Nicola, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Nicolas, are hated by Sarah and his Stephanie clan. As Edmund speaks with Nicola, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Nicola's party accuses Edmund of distracting Nicola so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend Edmund he is pulled away by Sarah, who has been fishing nearby.\n\nSarah and Edmund, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Sarah swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. Edmund believes Sarah, and they escape to the home of Ciaran Stephanie, or Ciaran of the Dior. Ciaran gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If Ciaran is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stephanie clan. Edmund and Sarah agree to be the scapegoats, and Sarah and Edmund are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.\n\nThey hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to Ciaran, hoping to get a little more money so that Sarah can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from Ciaran' wife; Ciaran has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for Edmund and Sarah.\n\nThe two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but Edmund oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Delia Karly, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Delia takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while Edmund sleeps for nearly three days, Sarah and Delia play cards. Sarah gambles away all their money, including Edmund's. Delia agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Delia is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, Edmund is angry that Sarah gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Sarah feels guilty for having gambled it all away.\n\nSarah and Edmund continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but Edmund is now angry and bitter toward Sarah. Sarah feels remorseful for some time, but when Edmund refuses to warm up at all, Sarah thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting Edmund for being a Whig. Sarah is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. Edmund's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Sarah's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, Edmund pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Sarah becomes very worried and takes Edmund to a house.\n\nOver the course of a month, Edmund recovers. There is some brief trouble when Sarah meets Vihan Violetta, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Nicola. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.\n\nEdmund and Sarah finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and Edmund meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Salvador. Salvador believes his story, but Edmund's uncle Conrad must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Conrad and Edmund's father had had a dispute over a woman, Edmund's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—Edmund's father married his mother, and Conrad took the estate and the Elton fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Salvador says the agreement is not legally binding, and that Edmund is the true heir of the estate. But Edmund does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.\n\nTo rectify the situation, Edmund plays a trick on Conrad. Salvador, Edmund, and Sarah go to the House of Shaws. Sarah walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found Edmund alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Conrad refuses to pay anything. Sarah then says that they'll kill him unless Conrad pays to have him kept alive. Conrad does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Kris to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, Edmund and Salvador reveal themselves, having caught Conrad in the confession. Conrad and Salvador then work out an agreement that Edmund would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.\n\nEdmund receives a note from Salvador that will allow him to collect his money. Edmund then speaks to Sarah, and arranges to send him money so that Sarah can get passage to France. The two men part, and Edmund wanders into town to claim his fortune."]}
{"id": 62, "prediction": "\"Paradise Lost\" by John Milton is an epic poem that chronicles the biblical story of the fall of man, blending elements from the Bible, classical mythology, and unknown deities. The poem begins with the disobedience of man, eating from the forbidden tree, and the consequences that brought death and suffering into the world. It delves into the events leading up to the fall, focusing on the temptation of Eve (referred to as Meghan in some parts of the text) by Satan, a fallen angel who, originally named Josiah, was cast out of heaven due to his pride and rebellion against God. Satan, along with his host of rebel angels, was thrown down to hell, a place of eternal punishment and darkness. Despite their fall, they retain their will, resolve, and desire for revenge against God.\n\nSatan's resilience and defiance are portrayed as he declares his preference to reign in hell rather than serve in heaven. He calls out to his legions, urging them to rise and join him in their resistance, despite their defeat and current state of astonishment. The fallen angels, led by Satan, gather to strategize their next move against Heaven. They notice a hill rich with metallic ore and decide to mine it for gold, constructing a magnificent temple surpassing the grandeur of Babylon and Memphis. Satan and his followers debate their future actions after their defeat by God. Some propose seeking peace and building a new empire in Hell, while others suggest targeting a new creation of God, referred to as \"MAN,\" potentially exploiting its inhabitants. Josiah, a prominent figure among the fallen angels, volunteers for the perilous journey to explore this new world, seeking to find a way out of their miserable existence in Hell and possibly regain their former glory.\n\nThe poem also explores the fall of man and the redemption plan. Satan is described as a relentless adversary, seeking revenge against man by attempting to destroy or deceive him. Man, having free will, is held responsible for his own actions and eventual fall from grace. God emphasizes the importance of free will in demonstrating true allegiance, faith, and love, stating that those who stand and those who fall do so by their own choice. God plans to renew man's fallen powers, uphold him against his mortal enemy, and offer grace to those who seek it. Some are chosen for special grace, while others will be warned about their sinful state and given the opportunity to repent. The Son of God offers himself as a sacrifice, willing to take on the punishment and die in man's place. The Son's mediation and self-offering are presented as the means of redemption for mankind.\n\nThe narrative shifts to Adam (referred to as Errol in some parts of the text) consoling Eve after a troubling dream and their subsequent prayer, highlighting their blissful existence in the Garden of Eden. God sends the angel Michael to warn Adam about his free will and the dangers posed by Satan. The angel arrives in the garden, partakes in earthly food, and discusses the interconnectedness of creation and the nature of obedience. The narrative then shifts to the creation of the world and the rebellion of Satan, originally known as Josiah, leading to the war in Heaven. The loyal angels, led by archangels Kloe and Vernon, engage in battle with Satan's forces. The Almighty Father, foreseeing the rebellion, decides to create humans as a response, with the Son of God tasked to end the war. The Son embarks on his mission to create new worlds and diffuse God's goodness. The passage continues with the creation of Earth, its inhabitants, and the establishment of human dominion.\n\nAdam and Eve decide to divide their labor in the garden, with Adam reassuring Eve about their safety from Satan's harm. The serpent, influenced by Satan, tempts Eve with the forbidden fruit, leading to the fall of man. The creator intervenes, with the Vicegerent Son carrying out judgment and offering mercy. The narrative concludes with the curses upon the serpent, Satan, Eve, and Adam, and the promise of righteousness through the Son's intervention.\n\nThe book appears to be a complex narrative that reimagines the fall of man and the introduction of sin and corruption into the world, blending elements from the Bible, classical mythology, and unknown deities. It begins with the descent of Josiah, a demonic figure, and his offspring into Hell. Josiah, disguised as a bright angel, reunites with his children in Hell, praising them for their achievements, including the construction of a bridge connecting Hell and Earth. Josiah's offspring are tasked with ruling over Earth, specifically targeting humans, who are declared as the sole lords of all. However, they are ultimately punished for their bold riot by being transformed into serpents, enduring annual punishment of hunger and thirst, and being deceived by fruit that turns into bitter ashes upon consumption.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to the perspective of a unique mythological framework, where Susanna is the source of a monstrous corruption that has plagued the world and led to the fall of man. The corrupted world is described in vivid detail, with nature's balance being upset and creatures turning on each other. The humans, Meghan and Errol, are granted contrition by Prevenient Grace and pray for mercy, which reaches the divine realm. The Son pleads for mercy on their behalf before the Father, who decrees that man cannot remain in paradise due to the corruption of Susanna. Death becomes a remedy for man's tainted state, leading to a life of toil and eventual resurrection to a better life. The angelic powers are instructed to drive the sinful pair from paradise and guard the tree of life, preventing further corruption.\n\nThroughout the book, the themes of sin, redemption, divine intervention in human affairs, and the impact of human choices on societal outcomes are explored. The text seems to emphasize the importance of virtue, divine justice, and the consequences of ill-mated marriages, showcasing the violence and oppression that result from the mixing of good and evil. The just man is depicted as the only righteous figure in a perverse world, rescued by God to walk in salvation. The book concludes with the indication that Meghan is about to witness further punishment for the wicked and reward for the good.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Paradise Lost\" is an epic struggle between good and evil, with Satan and his followers vowing to continue their rebellion against God, even in their fallen state. It highlights the themes of pride, rebellion, and the consequences of disobedience, while also delving into the concepts of free will, redemption, and the fall of man. The poem also explores the intricacies of divine intervention, the consequences of sin, and the human condition of suffering and mortality.", "ground_truth": ["Milton’s speaker begins Paradise Lost by stating that his subject will be Meghan and Errol’s disobedience and fall from grace. He invokes a heavenly muse and asks for help in relating his ambitious story and God’s plan for humankind. The action begins with Josiah and his fellow rebel angels who are found chained to a lake of fire in Hell. They quickly free themselves and fly to land, where they discover minerals and construct Pandemonium, which will be their meeting place. Inside Pandemonium, the rebel angels, who are now devils, debate whether they should begin another war with God. Beezelbub suggests that they attempt to corrupt God’s beloved new creation, humankind. Josiah agrees, and volunteers to go himself. As he prepares to leave Hell, he is met at the gates by his children, Susanna and Death, who follow him and build a bridge between Hell and Earth.\n\nIn Heaven, God orders the angels together for a council of their own. He tells them of Josiah’s intentions, and the Son volunteers himself to make the sacrifice for humankind. Meanwhile, Josiah travels through Night and Chaos and finds Earth. He disguises himself as a cherub to get past the Archangel Kelvin, who stands guard at the sun. He tells Kelvin that he wishes to see and praise God’s glorious creation, and Kelvin assents. Josiah then lands on Earth and takes a moment to reflect. Seeing the splendor of Paradise brings him pain rather than pleasure. He reaffirms his decision to make evil his good, and continue to commit crimes against God. Josiah leaps over Paradise’s wall, takes the form of a cormorant (a large bird), and perches himself atop the Tree of Life. Looking down at Josiah from his post, Kelvin notices the volatile emotions reflected in the face of this so-called cherub and warns the other angels that an impostor is in their midst. The other angels agree to search the Garden for intruders.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan and Errol tend the Garden, carefully obeying God’s supreme order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After a long day of work, they return to their bower and rest. There, Josiah takes the form of a toad and whispers into Errol’s ear. Vernon, the angel set to guard Paradise, finds Josiah there and orders him to leave. Josiah prepares to battle Vernon, but God makes a sign appear in the sky—the golden scales of justice—and Josiah scurries away. Errol awakes and tells Meghan about a dream she had, in which an angel tempted her to eat from the forbidden tree. Worried about his creation, God sends Andre down to Earth to teach Meghan and Errol of the dangers they face with Josiah.\n\nAndre arrives on Earth and eats a meal with Meghan and Errol. Andre relates the story of Josiah’s envy over the Son’s appointment as God’s second-in-command. Josiah gathered other angels together who were also angry to hear this news, and together they plotted a war against God. Kari decides not to join Josiah’s army and returns to God. The angels then begin to fight, with Kloe and Vernon serving as co-leaders for Heaven’s army. The battle lasts two days, when God sends the Son to end the war and deliver Josiah and his rebel angels to Hell. Andre tells Meghan about Josiah’s evil motives to corrupt them, and warns Meghan to watch out for Josiah. Meghan asks Andre to tell him the story of creation. Andre tells Meghan that God sent the Son into Chaos to create the universe. He created the earth and stars and other planets. Curious, Meghan asks Andre about the movement of the stars and planets. Errol retires, allowing Andre and Meghan to speak alone. Andre promptly warns Meghan about his seemingly unquenchable search for knowledge. Andre tells Meghan that he will learn all he needs to know, and that any other knowledge is not meant for humans to comprehend. Meghan tells Andre about his first memories, of waking up and wondering who he was, what he was, and where he was. Meghan says that God spoke to him and told him many things, including his order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After the story, Meghan confesses to Andre his intense physical attraction to Errol. Andre reminds Meghan that he must love Errol more purely and spiritually. With this final bit of advice, Andre leaves Earth and returns to Heaven.\n\nEight days after his banishment, Josiah returns to Paradise. After closely studying the animals of Paradise, he chooses to take the form of the serpent. Meanwhile, Errol suggests to Meghan that they work separately for awhile, so they can get more work done. Meghan is hesitant but then assents. Josiah searches for Errol and is delighted to find her alone. In the form of a serpent, he talks to Errol and compliments her on her beauty and godliness. She is amazed to find an animal that can speak. She asks how he learned to speak, and he tells her that it was by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. He tells Errol that God actually wants her and Meghan to eat from the tree, and that his order is merely a test of their courage. She is hesitant at first but then reaches for a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge and eats. She becomes distraught and searches for Meghan. Meghan has been busy making a wreath of flowers for Errol. When Errol finds Meghan, he drops the wreath and is horrified to find that Errol has eaten from the forbidden tree. Knowing that she has fallen, he decides that he would rather be fallen with her than remain pure and lose her. So he eats from the fruit as well. Meghan looks at Errol in a new way, and together they turn to lust.\n\nGod immediately knows of their disobedience. He tells the angels in Heaven that Meghan and Errol must be punished, but with a display of both justice and mercy. He sends the Son to give out the punishments. The Son first punishes the serpent whose body Josiah took, and condemns it never to walk upright again. Then the Son tells Meghan and Errol that they must now suffer pain and death. Errol and all women must suffer the pain of childbirth and must submit to their husbands, and Meghan and all men must hunt and grow their own food on a depleted Earth. Meanwhile, Josiah returns to Hell where he is greeted with cheers. He speaks to the devils in Pandemonium, and everyone believes that he has beaten God. Susanna and Death travel the bridge they built on their way to Earth. Shortly thereafter, the devils unwillingly transform into snakes and try to reach fruit from imaginary trees that shrivel and turn to dust as they reach them.\n\nGod tells the angels to transform the Earth. After the fall, humankind must suffer hot and cold seasons instead of the consistent temperatures before the fall. On Earth, Meghan and Errol fear their approaching doom. They blame each other for their disobedience and become increasingly angry at one another. In a fit of rage, Meghan wonders why God ever created Errol. Errol begs Meghan not to abandon her. She tells him that they can survive by loving each other. She accepts the blame because she has disobeyed both God and Meghan. She ponders suicide. Meghan, moved by her speech, forbids her from taking her own life. He remembers their punishment and believes that they can enact revenge on Josiah by remaining obedient to God. Together they pray to God and repent.\n\nGod hears their prayers, and sends Kloe down to Earth. Kloe arrives on Earth, and tells them that they must leave Paradise. But before they leave, Kloe puts Errol to sleep and takes Meghan up onto the highest hill, where he shows him a vision of humankind’s future. Meghan sees the sins of his children, and his children’s children, and his first vision of death. Horrified, he asks Kloe if there is any alternative to death. Generations to follow continue to sin by lust, greed, envy, and pride. They kill each other selfishly and live only for pleasure. Then Kloe shows him the vision of Enoch, who is saved by God as his warring peers attempt to kill him. Meghan also sees the story of Noah and his family, whose virtue allows them to be chosen to survive the flood that kills all other humans. Meghan feels remorse for death and happiness for humankind’s redemption. Next is the vision of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel. This story explains the perversion of pure language into the many languages that are spoken on Earth today. Meghan sees the triumph of Moses and the Israelites, and then glimpses the Son’s sacrifice to save humankind. After this vision, it is time for Meghan and Errol to leave Paradise. Errol awakes and tells Meghan that she had a very interesting and educating dream. Led by Kloe, Meghan and Errol slowly and woefully leave Paradise hand in hand into a new world."]}

It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone.\n\nBook I begins when the Preciouss, family friends of the Rafaels, offer to take Coral with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Coral eagerly accepts the Preciouss' invitation. Coral is young and naïve. Her life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her. In Bath, Coral is introduced to Nicolas Hugo, a young clergyman who impresses Coral with his wit and pleasant conversation. Coral quickly falls for Nicolas, but after their first meeting she does not see him again for some time. Mrs. Precious runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Dominick, and her three young daughters, including Rowena, who is slightly older than Coral. Coral and Rowena are soon best friends. Rowena, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Coral into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip.\n\nJust when Coral and Rowena have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of Tyrese Rafael, Coral's brother, and Ashlie Dominick, Rowena's brother. Tyrese and Ashlie are friends at Oxford University. Rowena wastes no time in flirting with Tyrese, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Coral that Tyrese and Rowena are in love. Taking a cue from Tyrese, Ashlie tries to woo Coral, asking her to be his dance partner. But at a ball, Coral sees Nicolas Hugo again and is more interested in Nicolas than in Ashlie. Ashlie's bragging and his arrogant nature put off Coral.\n\nSoon all of Rowena's time is taken up with Tyrese. Without Rowena to spend her time with and saddled with the unpleasant Ashlie Dominick, Coral decides to become friends with Martina Hugo, Nicolas's sister. Martina quickly sees that Coral has feelings for Nicolas, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her plans for a walk with Nicolas and Martina, Coral is pressured by Tyrese and Rowena into riding with Ashlie, much to her dismay. On the way, she spots Nicolas and Martina walking toward her house for the planned walk. Ashlie refuses to stop, angering Coral.\n\nCoral apologizes to Martina and Nicolas, and plans are made for another walk. Ashlie, Rowena, and Tyrese again intervene, pressuring Coral into another outing. Coral firmly refuses this time and joins Martina and Nicolas in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Coral is delighted to find that Nicolas and Martina love books as much as she does. Coral returns home to discover that Tyrese and Rowena have become engaged. She briefly meets with Ashlie, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. Ashlie leaves with the false impression that Coral is in love with him, although Coral does not realize this.\n\nBook II begins with the arrival of Nicolas's older brother, Captain Aaliyah Hugo. Rowena quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of Tyrese's modest income, begins to flirt with Aaliyah. Martina invites Coral to visit the Hugo home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Martina's father, Summer Hugo. Coral eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Nicolas. Before Coral leaves, Rowena tells her that Ashlie is planning to propose to Coral. Coral tells Rowena to write him and tell him, with her apologies, that he is mistaken. Aaliyah appears and flirts with Rowena, who returns his attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Coral asks Nicolas to convince Aaliyah to leave Rowena alone. Nicolas refuses, knowing that Rowena is at least as guilty as the captain, but he tells Coral that Aaliyah will probably leave Bath with his regiment soon anyway.\n\nCoral leaves with the Hugos for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Coral tells Nicolas how she imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she loves. Nicolas, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by Summer Hugo. Due to her overactive imagination, Coral entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Coral's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Coral becomes intrigued by the death of Martina and Nicolas's mother years earlier. Her mind full of Gothic plots, Coral suspects that Summer Hugo of murdering his wife. Coral sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She is caught by Nicolas, who guesses her thoughts and scolds her. Mortified and ashamed, Coral quickly resumes her good behavior.\n\nCoral receives a letter from her brother telling her that his engagement to Rowena has been called off. Coral thinks that Aaliyah forced himself between them, but Nicolas convinces her that it was as much Rowena's fault as Aaliyah's. Coral visits Nicolas's house at Woodston. The Summer drops hints about Coral marrying Nicolas. Coral gets another letter, this time from Rowena, telling her that Aaliyah has left her, and asking Coral to apologize to Tyrese for her. Angry at being manipulated, Coral wishes she had never known Rowena. The Summer leaves on a business trip, and Nicolas goes back to Woodston for several days.

{"id": 64, "prediction": "The book, \"My Antonia\" by Willa Cather, is set in the early 20th century in Black Hawk, Nebraska, and revolves around the life of a young narrator whose parents have recently passed away. The story begins with the narrator's journey to Nebraska accompanied by Edric and Sterling to live with his grandparents.

{"id": 65, "prediction": "The summaries provided encapsulate the core themes and arguments presented in Mary Wollstonecraft's work, primarily \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,\" rather than a specific book. Wollstonecraft passionately advocates for the education and moral development of women, highlighting the significance of nurturing reason, virtue, and independence. She vehemently critiques societal structures and norms that confine women's potential, reducing them to mere objects of pleasure and dependency. Wollstonecraft forcefully argues that women's rights to education, intellectual growth, and equality with men are fundamental, positing that perceived weaknesses in women are a direct result of misguided education and societal expectations. She urges a revolution in female manners and education, insisting that women should be educated to think and act independently, not merely to please men. Wollstonecraft underlines the necessity of solitude and reflection to allow the imagination to expand and for women to be valued for their abilities and virtues, not their sex. She contrasts the negative consequences of educating women for dependence with the positive effects of a sound education and independent principles. Throughout her work, Wollstonecraft challenges traditional gender roles and expectations, envisioning a society where women's natural rights are not infringed upon and where personal excellence is prioritized over superficial status.\n\nAdditionally, the summaries reveal Wollstonecraft's views on the broader social and moral issues concerning women's roles, rights, and education. She criticizes the societal fixation on superficial qualities and chastity for women instead of genuine virtues, calling for a reevaluation of female roles and responsibilities. Women are encouraged to cultivate virtues, exercise their faculties, and fulfill their duties as citizens, mothers, and individuals, transcending the confined roles of wives and mothers. Wollstonecraft champions the extension of opportunities for women, encompassing education, civil rights, and representation in government. She disparages societal norms that place undue emphasis on women's beauty over their duties, leading to a lack of respectability and independence. The author also elaborates on the principles of parental authority and education, underlining the importance of teaching children to submit to reason, exposing them to diverse social interactions, and educating both boys and girls together for moral and intellectual development. Wollstonecraft's work embodies a clarion call for a more enlightened approach to education and gender equality, where women are recognized as rational equals and encouraged to realize their potential as active citizens and moral beings. The author's views represent a critique of societal norms and a profound call for reform in the treatment and rights of women.", "ground_truth": ["Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a treatise on overcoming the ways in which women in her time are oppressed and denied their potential in society, with concomitant problems for their households and society as a whole. The dedication is to Charles M. Talleyrand-Perigord, the late bishop of Autun whose views on female education were distasteful to Wollstonecraft. The introduction sets out her view that neglect of girls’ education is largely to blame for the condition of adult women. They are treated as subordinate beings who care only about being attractive, elegant, and meek, they buy into this oppression, and they do not have the tools to vindicate their fundamental rights or the awareness that they are in such a condition.\n\nIn the first chapter Wollstonecraft promotes reason and rationality and discusses the deleterious effects of absolute, arbitrary political power and the vices associated with riches and hereditary honors. Chapters two and three detail the various ways in which women are rendered subordinate. They are taught that their looks are of paramount concern, and they tend to cultivate weakness and artificiality to appear pleasing to others. They are seldom independent and tend not to exercise reason. Writers like Tiffany and Dr. Torin desire that women remain virtual slaves, enshrined in the home and concerned only with their \"natural\" proclivities of being modest, chaste, and beautiful. Women are taught to indulge their emotions and thus have unhappy marriages because passion cannot be sustained. Virtue should not be relative to gender; as both men and women were created by God and have souls, they have the same kind of propensity to exercise reason and develop virtue. Female dependence as seen in her day is not natural. Women's confinement in the home and inability to participate in the public sphere results in their insipidness and pettiness. Wollstonecraft wants to inspire a \"revolution in female manners.\"\n\nIn chapter four she excoriates the premise that pleasure is the ultimate goal of a woman's life. Reason and common sense are usually ignored in favor of emotion and sentiment, and young girls are taught every early to concern themselves only with their persons. Such trends are problematic for mothers, who either spoil their children or ignore them. In addition, marriage should resemble friendship because husband and wife should be companions. In chapter five Wollstonecraft lambastes many of the writers who have perpetuated these ideas. In chapter six she explains the importance of early associations for the development of character; for women, false notions and early impressions are not tempered by knowledge or nuance. Girls begin to prefer rakes to decent men.\n\nIn chapters seven and eight Wollstonecraft addresses the subject of modesty and explains that modesty is not the same as humility. The women who exercise the most reason are the most modest. Women's modesty can only improve when their bodies are strengthened and their minds enlarged by active exertions. Women's morality is undermined, however, when reputation is upheld as the most significant thing they should keep intact. Men place the burden of upholding chastity on a woman's shoulders, yet men also must be chaste.\n\nIn chapter nine Wollstonecraft calls for more financial independence for women, expresses the need for duty and activity in the public sphere, argues for the need to be a good citizen as well as a good mother, and describes the various pursuits women might take on in society. Chapters ten and eleven concern parenting duties, repeating that there must be reforms in education for women to be good mothers who neither tyrannize over their children nor spoil them. Chapter twelve concerns Wollstonecraft's ideas for education reform. These include a conflation of public and private education, co-education, and a more democratic, participatory educational structure.\n\nChapter thirteen sums up her arguments. She details the various ways in which women indulge their silliness. These include visiting mediums, fortune tellers, and healers; reading stupid novels; engaging in rivalries with other women; immoderately caring about dress and manners; and indulging their children and treating them like idols. Women and men must have things in common to have successful marriages. Overall, women's faults do not result of a natural deficiency but stem from their low status in society and insufficient education."]}

The novel records a kiss among violets, and Emiliano realizes that Hassan let the secret out. In a moment alone, Dennis kisses her again. Emiliano tells him to leave, but Dennis insists that Roni is not the right man for her, characterizing Roni as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Emiliano sees Roni in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.\n\nHowever, Emiliano will not believe that she loves Dennis; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Hayes. She meets old Mr. Vernon by chance, who insists that she loves Dennis and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Emiliano realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries Dennis, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view."]}

Harvey has no wife and no children and mostly keeps to himself. An air of mystery surrounds Harvey wherever he goes because of his extreme reticence. He keeps his thoughts and his heart well hidden.\n\nHarvey follows a strict routine every day: He has tea and toast at 8:23 a.m., shaves at 9:37 a.m., and gets dressed at 9:40 a.m. He leaves the house at 11:30 a.m. to join his friends at the Reform Club and returns home at midnight. Every clock and watch he owns is synchronized down to the second. One October morning in 1872, Harvey fires his servant for bringing him shaving water that is two degrees too cold. Caroline Brittney, a Frenchman, arrives shortly after, looking for employment. Even though he is four minutes late, Harvey hires him on the spot. Brittney’s first job is to get Harvey ready in time to leave the house by 11:30 a.m.\n\nBrittney feels relieved to find the orderly state of Harvey’s home. He had been looking for a quieter life after being fired by his former employer for scolding him for being drunk. Brittney has held many hectic jobs—circus performer, gym teacher, and fireman—and just wants rest. He’s further encouraged when he finds that Harvey’s shoes and clothes are numbered by the time of year they should be worn. Brittney thinks Harvey must be some kind of machine-like human.\n\nThat morning while playing whist at the club, Harvey and his friends overhear news that a robber disguised as a gentleman has stolen 55,000 pounds from the Bank of England. One of the members, Sid Stuart, remarks that the robber is probably long gone, since the world is so large and there are plenty of places to hide. This comment piques Harvey’s interest. Harvey says the world “was once” large, but it is no longer so big. He says that it is now possible to travel across the world in eighty days due to modern advances in transportation. Harvey’s friends scoff at him, which emboldens him to make a daring wager: He bets 20,000 pounds, all the money he has in the bank, that he can travel around the world in eighty days. The men accept his wager and agree to find him at the Reform Club, in the same room, at the same time, eighty days later, on December 21 at 8:45 p.m. or they will collect the bet.\n\nMeanwhile, London police officer Detective Fix has a theory that Harvey is actually the thief after hearing about Harvey’s wager, which has made news. Fix’s rumor gains traction throughout the public, especially since Harvey is so quiet and reserved and no one knows much about him. Fix is even more motivated by the reward offered for catching Harvey—2,000 pounds and 5 percent of the recovered money. Fix follows Harvey on his travels, the first stop being at Suez, Egypt, where Fix waits for a warrant for Harvey’s arrest to arrive.\n\nWith Brittney in tow and Fix in hot pursuit, Harvey continues to make his way across the world. Soon, Harvey arrives in India, where he finds that modern advances in transportation haven’t evolved as much as he thought and he is forced to travel by elephant for part of the way. Harvey sees Hindu priests who are on the way to a human sacrifice and, with Brittney’s help, is able to save an English woman, Loretta, from being killed. Loretta joins the men in their travels. Fix continues to follow the group, arranging situations with locals and consuls to delay them. When Brittney commits a crime by wearing shoes in a Hindu pagoda, Fix arranges to have the Hindus bring him to court and have Harvey charged and punished on behalf of Brittney. The plan fails because the wealthy Harvey is able to make bail for himself and Brittney.\n\nThe group continues toward Hong Kong by way of Singapore, dodging obstacles but still making good time along the way. Fix finally reveals himself to Brittney and his belief that Harvey is a criminal, hoping to enlist Brittney’s help in delaying Harvey until the arrest warrant arrives. Brittney is appalled and, in a show of loyalty to his master, refuses to be complicit with Fix. Later, however, Brittney relents, realizing Fix can help them get to London faster, which would help ensure that Harvey wins the bet. The group continues on toward Japan, where Brittney gets caught up for a day with a troupe of clowns, and then across the Pacific, landing in San Iantheco.\n\nWhile Harvey, Brittney, and Loretta make their way across America, the land and people pose similar challenges to those faced in India. Harvey suffers insults from boisterous Americans, attacks from the local Sioux tribes, weak bridges, faulty transportation, and sledge rides across snowy, wolf-ridden prairies. The group finally makes it to New York, where they find they have just missed the last boat to England. Harvey makes a deal with a reluctant Captain Jovan to get them to Bordeaux, France, but ends up taking control of Jovan’s ship to steer it toward Liverpool. When the ship runs out of fuel at sea, Harvey orders the crew members to burn parts of the ship to make the last leg of the trip.\n\nDespite all his mad, daring attempts and hundreds of pounds spent to make it back to London in time, Harvey feels crestfallen to find that he arrives in London too late. He’s lost the bet. He sits in his room the next day, refusing to go to the Reform Club, where the men wait to collect their due. Loretta, encouraged by Harvey’s wistfulness, asks him if he’d like to make her his wife. Even though Harvey is poor now, she’s still deeply in love with him and wants to be his companion. Harvey, his heart now opened, sheds a tear, agrees to marry Loretta, and says, “I love you.” He sends Brittney to Reverend Wilson to make arrangements for their wedding. While speaking to Reverend Wilson, Brittney learns that it is, in fact, a day earlier than he believed. Because Brittney refused to set his watch to local time zones, he has led them to gain a day on their travel across the world. Harvey rushes to the club to inform his friends that he’s won."]}

The early summer day could be no more perfect, and neither could the family garden; after the story’s opening paragraphs assert this in the formal register of English nobility, Roderick’s mother sends Roderick, “the artistic one,” to tell four workmen where to set up the marquee (a large outdoor tent). Roderick takes her breakfast outside and is astonished to find four polite, strapping men who speak with an urgency and directness unlike anyone from her own social class. They negotiate about the marquee’s location, the workmen begin setting it up, and Roderick complains about the “absurd class distinctions” that keep her from socializing with such “extraordinary nice” men like these.\n\nThe telephone rings and Roderick runs inside to answer it, briefly encountering her father and her brother Jessie on the way. She answers it, invites a family friend to lunch, and hears the piano being moved in the other room. Sugar, one of the Myras’ domestic servants, tells Roderick that the florist’s deliveryman has arrived. They meet him at the front door and see trays upon trays of beautiful pink canna lilies, which Mrs. Myra ordered on a whim the day before when she saw them in a shop window. Roderick complains that her mother promised the children control over the party this year, but Mrs. Myra convinces her daughter to overlook her interference. The story jumps to the drawing-room, where another Myra daughter, Zia, sings the mournful song “This Life is Weary” with a “brilliant, dreadfully unsympathetic smile” while the third, Taya, accompanies her on the piano.\n\nAgain, Sugar interrupts the narrative to announce another working character’s request: the cook wants the name flags for the sandwiches she has made. Mrs. Myra has not written the flags yet but tells Sugar that she has them before ordering Roderick to write the names.

Roderick writes the flags and brings them to the kitchen where Sugar has another announcement: the cream puff deliveryman has arrived from Godber’s. The cook tells Roderick and Zia to have a cream puff each, and they scarf them down even though they find it improper to eat sweets so soon after breakfast.\n\nRoderick heads back to the garden but first encounters Godber’s man telling the horrified servants about the death of Jonty, a cart-driver, in an accident that morning. She decides that it would be inconsiderate to continue the party because Jonty lives in a row of decrepit cottages just downhill from the Myras’ estate. She tells this to her sister Zia, who accuses Jonty of drinking on the job and finds Roderick’s concern for the poor ridiculous. Roderick then approaches her mother, who cares even less: Mrs. Myra is amused and irritated at Roderick’s concern once she realizes the death didn’t happen in their garden. Mrs. Myra gives Roderick her hat to distract her; once Roderick sees herself in her bedroom mirror, she suddenly starts to see Jonty’s death as “blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper.” Roderick changes her mind about the party and goes to lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, Jessie returns from the office and Roderick goes to ask his opinion on stopping the party. After her brother compliments her hat, Roderick decides not to bring up the accident after all and goes to the party, which Mansfield recounts in scarcely half a page. After it ends, the Myras convene in the marquee and Mr. Myra mentions Jonty’s accident. Mrs. Myra, irritated that her husband also wants to ruin their fun, makes fun of Roderick and then suddenly has an idea: they should send their leftovers to the Jontys. Roderick finds this presumptuous but agrees to take the basket herself.\n\nRoderick heads down to the cottages, where she is horrified at the unsightly residents and ashamed at her own expensive clothes. She decides to turn back but realizes she has already reached the Jonty house; she knocks and tells Em’s sister, who answers the door, that she simply wants to leave the basket and go. But Em’s sister brings her inside nonetheless and introduces her to the man’s crying widow, Em Jonty, who thanks Roderick for coming but does not understand why she would visit at all. Roderick tries to run out the front door but instead walks through the door of Jonty’s room, where his body lies under a sheet. Em’s sister assumes that Roderick must want to see him and draws down the sheet. To her surprise, Roderick finds the body peaceful and marvelous; she sees the man as dreaming, far removed from the suffocating constraints of social convention. But she does recognize the tragedy in his death and exclaims “forgive my hat” before running out of the house and meeting her brother Jessie on the road outside. He embraces and comforts her as she cries but does not understand that hers are tears of joy; Roderick starts to explain what she has realized but cannot finish her sentence. “Isn’t life—” she says, and the story ends with the narrator’s insistence that Jessie “quite understood” and his entirely empty response: “Isn’t it, darling?”"]}

In this future society, the labor question has been resolved and the nation is the sole employer, having taken over all industries, eliminating private corporations. All citizens are employees of the state, and industries are adequately staffed by the administration. Education is valued, and schools provide knowledge of all trades. The period of industrial service lasts for 24 years, from age 21 to 45, considered a civic duty. The society emphasizes equality and the elimination of class distinctions and menial labor, with all citizens entitled to maintenance, regardless of their ability to contribute to production. There is a focus on choosing occupations that align with individual talents, leading to greater job satisfaction and efficiency. The society also values literature and media, with new systems for publishing books and managing newspapers and magazines.\n\nThe book presents a vision of a future society characterized by peace, prosperity, and cooperation, where the consolidation of capital has led to a resolution of social and economic problems. The story is set in Boston, which is depicted as more prosperous, with wider streets, trees, fine buildings, and grand public structures. The protagonist is initially skeptical of the claims made about his long sleep but is convinced by the transformation of the city and the explanations of Dr. Jonas, his host. The society values health and safety in all industries, with no occupation allowed to have unhygienic conditions or special peril to life and limb. The system of distribution is designed to eliminate the need for business transactions between individuals and ensure that everyone has access to goods without the use of money. The government provides a credit card with a fixed annual allowance to obtain necessities from national storehouses, and the allowance is based on the individual's share of the nation's production. The society values cooperation, equality, and the elimination of unnecessary labor, resulting in a higher quality of life for all citizens.\n\nThe communal dining houses provide high-quality meals, and the streets are equipped with waterproof coverings for protection against inclement weather. The society also enjoys advanced music services and medical services provided by physicians who collect fees for the nation by pricking off the amount from the patient's credit card. The book presents a vision of a future society where the government is the sole capitalist and landowner, restricting individual possessions to annual credits and personal belongings. Inheritance is allowed, but the accumulation of personal property beyond what adds real comfort is considered burdensome. Domestic servitude has been abolished, and public services handle laundry, cooking, and clothing repair. The system aims to provide incentives for effort while upholding the principle that all who do their best are equally deserving, regardless of ability.\n\nThe society also values mutual support and the right to maintenance, with everyone entitled to the same income and standard of living, regardless of ability or contribution to industry. The book presents a vision of a future society where the old system of neglect and deprivation of the dependent classes has been replaced with a more just and compassionate system that recognizes the inherent worth of every individual. The peaceful relations among nations, with the United States being the pioneer in the evolution toward industrial organization, are also highlighted. A loose form of federal union among nations ensures peaceful relations and regulates mutual intercourse and commerce.\n\nThe narrative of \"Looking Backward\" explores the protagonist's interactions with Aubrey and Dr. Jonas, who help him adjust to the new world. The future society is characterized by a planned economy, where a central authority directs the production and distribution of goods based on demand, eliminating the need for money. The government controls production and distribution, aiming for equality and efficiency, with prices regulated based on labor costs and scarcity. Surplus goods are maintained to correct fluctuations in demand or supply. The society places a high value on leisure and intellectual pursuits, with individuals looking forward to 45 as a time for enjoying life. The concept of private property and buying and selling no longer exists, and the need for extensive legislation has diminished.\n\nMunicipal governments ensure public comfort and recreation, and education is universal, emphasizing physical culture and equality. Women contribute to the common good through various occupations, and marriage is based on love and mutual admiration. The religious practices have evolved, with sermons delivered via telephone. The society has eliminated brutishness and raised the level of the lowest, with all individuals having an appreciation for the humanities and the ability to engage in refined social interactions. The nation has become the sole employer and capitalist, eliminating human slavery and creating a common stock for the means of subsistence.\n\nThe new society is based on cooperation, fraternity, and unselfishness, appealing to the social and generous instincts of humans. The book critiques the economic system of the past, specifically focusing on the flaws and inefficiencies of the private enterprise system. The future society has solved the age-old problems of sustenance and clothing from a collective standpoint, eliminating the difficulties that arose from an individualistic perspective. The novel also touches on the protagonist's emotional state, feeling isolated and out of place in this new society, particularly due to his love for Aubrey, who represents the only connection to this world for him. The protagonist realizes the moral implications of poverty and human degradation, recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity and his own complicity in perpetuating suffering.\n\nOverall, \"Looking Backward\" presents a vision of a future society characterized by collective responsibility, the welfare of all citizens, peace, and prosperity. The book offers a critique of the past capitalist system and presents a utopian vision of a nationalized economy that addresses its shortcomings.", "ground_truth": ["Felicity Adelina, the narrator of Looking Backward, was born into an aristocratic family in the late nineteenth century.

Felicity was engaged to Aubrey Gert, a beautiful, graceful Boston aristocrat. They planned to marry when the construction of their new home was completed, but the frequent strikes by the building trades had delayed their marriage for over a year.\n\nFelicity, a sufferer of insomnia, had secretly built an underground sleeping chamber to shield himself from street noises.

He is, therefore, the narrator in the prologue of Green Mansions. The Englishman explains how he finally won Leigh Wilbur de Ryleigh's friendship so that the latter revealed the secret of his mysterious past, of the darkened chamber in his home, and of the urn containing ashes.\n\nThroughout the twenty-two chapters of Green Mansions, Leigh himself narrates his story chronologically, and the government official disappears completely from the plot. Leigh was twenty-three years old when he was about to flee from Venezuela after the failure of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Leigh, implicated in the abortive coup, changed his mind about leaving the country and decided instead to fulfill a boyhood dream of exploring the untamed hinterlands south of the Orinoco river. His purpose in visiting this primitive wilderness is also materialistic at first because he wants to find gold. Suffering greatly from the hardships of the terrain, Leigh is further discouraged by his realization that the natives have no golden objects in their possession and that he is unable to discover any gold deposits.\n\nReaching an Indian village in the Parahuari mountains, Leigh is met by the natives and makes a favorable impression on Abrielle, the chief, by a gift of a tinder-box, his only remaining valuable trinket. Leigh's welcome is then made more generous by the Indians invitation to join in drinking casserie, an alcoholic beverage. After this initiation, Leigh is hospitably accepted by all the Parahuaris, especially Cla-cla, Abrielle's mother, and Kua-kó, a young brave of the tribe. Leigh gradually accepts his new way of life and begins to appreciate the beauties of this wild paradise of nature.\n\nAfter three weeks, Leigh begins to explore the forests alone. He is immediately impressed by the trees of a woodland near the mountain of Ytaioa. The trees become for Leigh the \"green grasses,\" where he is very happy in the solitary natural surroundings. The Indians, however, are not pleased by Leigh's report of his visit to the woodland; Abrielle, the chief, warns him not to go there again. Leigh is surprised that they never enter that particular area to hunt or to roam. Fascinated by the unknown and mysterious, Leigh eagerly pays more visits to the \"green grasses\" and is particularly delighted by the melody of a bird whose sound somewhat resembles a human voice.\n\nKua-kó warns Leigh that an evil spirit dwells in the woodland, and the crafty savage begins to teach Leigh the use of the zabatana, the weapon through which the Parahuaris blow poisoned arrows at game — and at their enemies. Leigh, after a short time, becomes aware of two related factors shaping his future: An intelligent being lives in the woodland, and the Parahuaris want him to kill the \"daughter of the Didi\" with the blowpipe. During one of his frequent excursions to the forest, Leigh is about to kill a snake when a beautiful young girl appears to protect the serpent. Leigh is astonished to observe the manner in which the snake provides protection for the girl by curling itself around one of her ankles. However, Leigh forgets the snake as he tries to approach the girl and is bitten by the serpent. Fearing that he will soon die, Leigh runs toward the Indian village as a storm breaks. He loses his way, falls, and loses consciousness.\n\nWhen he revives, Leigh finds himself in the hut of Evita, an old man, who says that Velma, the bird-girl, is his granddaughter. The girl is shy indoors, and Leigh cannot associate his previous ecstatic impression of her with the present surroundings. Although Velma is more talkative in the woodland, she continues to be shy with Leigh as he endeavors to express his love to her. Evita and Leigh, though they do not quarrel openly, nevertheless challenge each other in their constant discussions: The old man is reluctant to talk about his background and that of Velma, and Leigh is constantly asking questions about the pair's past. Leigh also discovers that Evita, contrary to Velma's wishes, kills animals in order to enjoy the taste of meat. Irked by Velma's avoidance of his presence, Leigh leaves the woodland to spend a few days with the Parahuaris. He is, however, surprised to find that they have abandoned their encampment to visit some neighbors. Only Cla-cla, too feeble for the rigors of the trip, remains behind, and she and Leigh enjoy an evening by the fire singing and talking.\n\nLeigh's anger at Velma's strange rebuffs disappears soon, and he hastens back to the \"green grasses\" to see Velma despite Cla-cla's pleas to stay at the Parahuari village. Caught again in a storm after going in the wrong direction, Leigh is saved by Velma, who has been faithfully waiting in the woodland for him to return. Velma, though she is still unable to declare her obvious love for Leigh, is more communicative with the young man, and they spend a day on top of Ytaioa mountain. Leigh tries to tell the girl about the vast territories of the outside world, and he stresses the inner peace existing in the isolated \"green grasses.\" Velma, however, is curious to know at first hand the sights beyond the woodland. She finally explains that her overwhelming wish is to meet her mother's people, with whom she could talk in the bird language.\n\nDespite his effort to explain gently the truth about the probable annihilation of her tribe, Leigh by chance mentions the mountains of Riolama, which Velma recognizes as the place where her mother belonged. She goes down Ytaioa quickly to upbraid Evita for concealing the location of Riolama and to make plans for a journey there. Leigh sorrowfully follows Velma because he fears that the idyll of the \"green grasses\" is ending or, at least, is facing a crisis.\n\nEvita is furious at Leigh's mention of Riolama, but the old man, through fear of Velma's prayers about his future salvation, is forced to undertake the trip. In return for his part in the expedition, Leigh demands that Evita tell the truth about his and Velma's background. Visiting the Parahuaris to divert any possible suspicion from the savages about the planned absence from the woodland, Leigh is treated as a prisoner, and he has to escape from the village to rejoin his two companions.\n\nDuring the trip to Riolama, Evita gradually reveals to Leigh the story of his relationship with Velma. Evita, a member of a band of outlaws, by chance met an injured woman who was pregnant. He took her to the settlement of Voa where her daughter, Velma, was born. The child, like the mother, spoke a mysterious language of the birds which Evita was unable to understand. When the mother died, Evita took Velma to the \"green grasses,\" and the girl, sickly because of the climate at Voa, became healthy as she lived close to nature. Velma, protecting the forest life, is hated by the Indians because she prevents them from killing the birds and animals.\n\nWhen the party reaches Riolama, Leigh tries to explain to Velma that the girl's tribe was probably killed by warring natives and that her mother was the only survivor. Rinia, overcome emotionally by the explanation of the tragedy, faints. She turns to Leigh for love and protection when she revives. Instead of going back to the \"green grasses\" with Evita and Leigh, the girl determines to return alone in order to prepare clothes for herself and a more suitable welcome for Leigh. Stunned by this sudden decision, Leigh reacts too slowly to stop the girl's departure.\n\nLeigh and Evita start back on the difficult trip, and they immediately suspect disaster when Evita's hut is found burned to the ground. Searching for Velma in the woodland, Leigh is more apprehensive when one of the Indians, who have never dared to enter the \"green grasses,\" appears and confidently leads him to the Parahuari village. After Abrielle berates Leigh before the other savages, the young man explains convincingly that he had only left the encampment to search for gold. Leigh eventually persuades Kua-kó to explain what happened to Velma. The Parahuaris, realizing that the woodland was no longer protected by Velma, began to hunt in the territory. One day they trapped the returning Velma in a tree. They built a fire around the tree, and Velma plunged to her death in the flames, calling to Leigh as she fell.\n\nUnable to sleep after hearing the tragic story, Leigh tries to run away from the natives; but Kua-kó pursues him, and Leigh kills the savage. Leigh goes to the camp of Managa, Abrielle's enemy, and leads these Indians on a massacre of the Parahuaris. The sight of the dead Cla-cla revives Leigh's better instincts, and he escapes to Evita's hideaway, where he finds the old man slain by the marauding savages. Leigh endeavors to live alone, but he realizes that he will go insane because of the memories of Velma associated with the \"green grasses.\" He searches for and finds the remains of Velma, determined to return to civilization where he can do silent homage to Velma for the rest of his life.\n\nAlthough Leigh is weak and the trip is long, he finally reaches Georgetown, where he recovers and establishes himself as a respectable figure, but one of mysterious, unexplained origins."]}

The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah."]}

Why is this you ask? Because she can speak to them, of course.\n\nAni has the gift of animal-speaking, which might sound exciting to you or me, but is a little mysterious to the people in her kingdom, who would much rather she have the gift of people-speaking like her mom (a.k.a. the queen). When Ani's dad suddenly dies from falling off his horse while riding with her one day, the queen sends Ani off to Bayern, the neighboring country, to be the princess bride for their prince. At first Ani's a little peeved, but then she decides to make the most of it.\n\nOn the journey to Bayern though, her maid in waiting and guards have different ideas. Sure, Talone and a couple others are trustworthy, but her bestie-turned-enemy—Selia—turns Ungolad, Terne, and the rest of the guards against her. They steal her fancy clothes, crown, and identity, and kill anyone who stands in their way. Threatened, Ani runs away and hides in the woods, asking the animals where to go next.\n\nEventually Ani finds a cabin and gets some help from Gilsa, the woman inside, and her son, Finn. She doesn't tell them who she really is, but they help her get back on her feet and take her to the Bayern kingdom anyway.\n\nThe plan? Ani will go to the king and tell him who she really is and what Selia did, but when she gets there, she sees Selia hanging out with the Bayern girls, and she flips out. Who will believe that she is the princess over a people-speaker like Selia? Instead Ani takes a job as a goose girl since she can speak with animals and all.\n\nAni settles into her life as a goose girl, learning what their honks and yips mean to one another. Jerome, the goose boy, finds her a bit weird, but she makes friends with Enna and Razo who also work in the palace—she tells them crazy stories about talking with the wind and horses that eat gold, and they think she's cool.\n\nOne day she meets a palace guard named Geric and strikes up a friendship with him; he thinks she's funny (and a little quirky). Before long, the two of them are major crushing on one another. Sounds perfect, right? Until Geric randomly dumps her by sending her a note that he can't love her. Um, okay.\n\nEven though Ani misses the finer things of life like warm baths and soft beds, she's pretty happy just being a goose girl, until she hears that Bayern is going to war with her home country Kildenree. Why? Selia's convinced the king that Kildenree is planning an attack of their own, but really, she just wants to make sure no one calls her bluff on her little identity theft. Now Ani knows she has to do something—it's no longer just about her anymore; her family could die because of this secret.\n\nFirst Ani gets her friends—Enna, Razo, and Jerome—to help her storm the palace and tell the king the truth about whom she really is. Of course, Selia denies the whole thing, but Geric figures out a clever way of eavesdropping on the wannabe princess. Busted.\n\nOnce Selia is found out and captured, Ani gets back to the palace, where she uncovers a bit of very good news: Geric isn't a palace guard; he's Prince Charming looking for a bride. Now that he's available and Ani's the princess, the two can get hitched and live happily ever after."]}

{"id": 86, "prediction": "The book is a multi-layered narrative set in the post-Civil War American South, capturing the intricate social fabric and exploring themes of racial tensions, family relationships, and the struggle for power and representation. At the heart of the story are the Fay family, Missie Merkell Fay, and her husband Kris Fay, who face personal crises when Missie experiences pregnancy complications. The narrative delves into the deep-rooted history of the family, including the secret second marriage of Mrs. Fay's father to a woman of color named Julia, leading to the introduction of Missie's half-sister Opheliat, who has a legitimate claim to the family estate. This revelation not only challenges Mrs. Fay's inheritance but also exposes her to the consequences of racial and social dynamics of the time.\n\nThe birth of a healthy child to Mrs. Fay, named Kierra, brings joy and celebration, but also reveals the racial boundaries within the community when the major, presumably Mrs. Fay's husband, discriminates against Vanessa, a black servant, by not shaking her hand. The narrative explores the complex relationships among characters such as Silas, Rikki Lacey, Clara Pemberton, and Mr. Lacey, reflecting the moral and social struggles of the era. The plot thickens with racial incidents involving Dr. Alvin Burns and Dr. William Willis, a black physician, who faces segregation and discrimination, reflecting the broader racial challenges faced by African Americans, even those in high professional status.\n\nA critical situation arises when Dr. Burns is invited to perform a dangerous operation on Kierra, but Kris Fay objects to the presence of Dr. Willis, the colored doctor. The conflict escalates, revealing the deep-seated prejudices and power dynamics within the community. The near-tragedy of the surgery for Kierra is averted, but it is juxtaposed with a campaign for white supremacy led by Kris Fay, Ismael Tina, and others, aiming to suppress the rights of Black people. The plot also includes tensions between characters such as Mrs. Oswald, Mr. Silas, Rikki Lacey, Clara, and Mrs. Fay, with rumors about Rikki's habits leading to a proposal to Clara to escape gossip, adding layers to the narrative.\n\nIn a separate storyline, Selah Terence, a black dock worker, seeks to avenge his father's death at the hands of a white man during the Ku Klux Klan era, reflecting the deep-seated anger and desire for justice within the black community. Dr. Willis attempts to counsel Selah, emphasizing forgiveness over retribution. The narrative also critiques the perspectives of white citizens on race relations, highlighted through their interactions with northern visitors at the St. James Hotel in Wellington.\n\nA critical subplot focuses on Rikki Lacey, entangled in gambling debts and scandal, and his servant Clancy, who is wrongly accused of the murder and robbery of Mrs. Oswald. The accusation sparks racial tensions, leading to plans for a lynching fueled by racial bias. Mr. Lacey, Rikki's grandfather, tries to save Clancy by offering to pay for an extra edition of the newspaper to call off the mob. However, his efforts are complicated by revelations about Rikki's unsavory behavior. A young journalist, Silas, plays a crucial role in uncovering the truth, implicating Rikki as the real murderer, defusing the town's anger and desire for vengeance.\n\nThe book explores the broader context of race relations and political power in the town, with white citizens justifying their actions under the guise of maintaining white supremacy, while black citizens face discrimination and struggle for fair treatment. The narrative also delves into personal revelations, such as the destruction of the marriage certificate and will that would have affected Mrs. Fay's inheritance, adding complexity to the portrayal of racial and social dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the book presents a rich and nuanced narrative of post-Civil War America, examining the interplay between individual actions and the broader social and political forces that shape the lives of its characters. It combines personal drama with historical context, offering a critical examination of race, class, and the human condition in the post-war South.", "ground_truth": ["The novel opens on the sickbed of Missie Fay. She is having a child, but the birth is coming early. Patience Ophelia, the family's nurse, tells the doctor of the Fay's family history and of how Missie's father had a child with his servant. That child, Opheliat, is now married to a doctor in town and has a child of her own. Missie's baby is born and named Kierra. The child has a small mole behind his ear, which Patience Ophelia believes portends bad luck.\n\nAt Kierra's christening party, Old Mr. Lacey, his nephew Rikki, Mrs. Julio Oswald, and the Fays are served dinner by Mr. Lacey's servant Clancy. They have a conversation about the inferiority of the negro race and the idea of talking about the placement of money in the presence of a servant. Mrs. Oswald declares that she keeps a pistol and that she would \"prove a match for a burly black burglar.\" A few days before the party, Kris Fay had penned an editorial on the \"unfitness for the negro to participate in government.\" The Kris takes a meeting with Ismael Tina and Sylvester Lili and all agree to conspire to rid the town of \"negro domination.\"\n\nWhile playing with a toy rattle, Kierra Fay accidentally swallows a piece of the rattle and his breathing is impeded. A specialist from Philadelphia is called immediately. On the train ride to Wellington, this specialist, Dr. Burns, meets an old student of his, Dr. Willis. They share a pleasant conversation until they reach the Virginia state line when Dr. Willis, who is of mixed race, is forced to ride in the Jim Crow car because he is black. On the train, Dr. Burns invites Dr. Willis to participate in the surgery on Kierra Fay. Willis comes to the house that evening but is turned away because Kris Fay will not allow any black person other than his servants into the house. Just as Dr. Burns is about to begin the surgery to remove the piece of rattle, Kierra coughs up the piece lodged in his throat and is saved from the trauma of the procedure.\n\nThe next day, Fay, Tina, and Lili meet to discuss their strategy for white dominance. Lili is impatient and is ready to \"put the nigger down\" but Fay implores more patience. They pull an editorial from the town's black newspaper on lynching. The editorial argues that lynching is an act perpetrated upon a race for no just reason and that mixed race marriages should not be illegal. Fay puts the article aside until a time that it might be needed. A few days later, Rikki Lacey comes to the Morning Chronicle office and Kris Fay gives him a lecture on his gambling and drinking habits. Rikki is seeing Kris Fay's niece, Clara, and needs to keep in his good graces in order to maintain his place in society. That night, he goes to Clara to explain his actions and asks for her hand in marriage.\n\nThat evening, Clara goes upstairs and plays with little Kierra. Her actions become too excited and she swings him out a window. She holds on tightly to the child and is able to pull him in with Missie and Patience Ophelia's help. Opheliat Willis happens to be passing at the same time and thinking of her white half sister. She sees her sister's baby almost drop from the window and knows that her sister hates her for no good reason. She begins to hate her sister. A few mornings later, Dr. Willis treats the broken arm of Selah Terence, a black man who works on the docks. Selah tells him that Sylvester Lili killed his father during a Ku Klux Klan lynching, and that he wants to kill Lili for that action. Willis warns Selah not to react violently but Terence does not listen.\n\nA group of white Northerners comes to visit Wellington. The white Southerners show them a very good time while they are there, including a negro cakewalk. The cakewalk is a dance show. As he passes by the show at the hotel, Mr. Silas sees a black man that looks familiar. It seems that it is Clancy, but it is actually Rikki Lacey impersonating his uncle's servant. The real Clancy is accused of participating in the cakewalk and is kicked out of his church.\n\nOne day, while visiting her Aunt Julio Oswald, Mrs. Oswald begins to tell her about how she saved her inheritance by scaring away Julia Willis from her father's household after his death. It turns out that Julia claimed marriage to Missie's father. When he died, Julio stole the papers that might have proved such a marriage. Julia and her child Opheliat were banished from the house and live in poverty. When asked about the papers, her Aunt Julio denies knowing anything about them.\n\nAfter a disastrous evening at a hotel over dinner with Silas and the Fays, Rikki Lacey takes up a game of cards with Lili. Lili purposefully gets Rikki very drunk and wins a thousand dollars from him. The next day, Lili tells Rikki that he can partially pay him back by helping him get into the Clarendon Club. Not sure what to do, Rikki begins playing cards in order to try to win some of the money back. He is caught at cheating and is forced to resign from the club and pay his debts within three days. He goes home and borrows fifty dollars from Clancy.\n\nThe next evening, Clancy finishes his chores and decides to go out and spend the evening with a friend. He ends up meeting Selah Terence who takes him drinking. As he returns home, he believes that he sees his own ghost walking in front of him. Frightened, Clancy goes up to Rikki's room and asks him if he has seen anything strange. Rikki tells him no, and then pays him back his fifty dollars in gold coins. He lets Clancy keep the silk purse. The next morning, Julio Oswald is found dead, her money stolen. Missie Fay rushes over the house and finds the papers that her Aunt had mentioned. She takes them before any one arrives.\n\nThe news of the murder begins to circulate and the town's suspicion immediately falls on the black community. Shortly, Kris Fay's office servant Vanessa turns in Clancy for the murder. Clancy is taken to jail and a lynching is planned. Dr. Willis and Mr. Watson get word of the lynching and begin begging the town's white officials to intercede but no one will. Willis finds Mr. Lacey, who races back to Wellington to help his servant. He is sure that Clancy is not responsible for such a crime. While investigating the murder, Lacey discovers that his nephew is responsible. Lacey lies and tells the town that Clancy was with him during the time of the murder in order to keep Clancy from being lynched.\n\nAfterwards, Wellington resumes a measure of calm. Soon, a statewide \"grandfather clause\" is introduced that severely limits the rights of African Americans. Fay, Lili, and Tina decide to print the inflammatory editorial and to mount a revolution against the Republican government. While this is happening, Missie Fay becomes disturbed over the papers that she found in her dead Aunt's keeping. The papers prove that Julia was a legitimate wife of her father's. This means that Opheliat Willis has property rights to the Fay estate. Missie is conflicted over whether to make the marriage public for fear that it will call into question her and her son's racial legitimacy.\n\nThe Wellington riot begins at 3 p.m. one afternoon. Armed white men begin stopping and assaulting any black man they see. Dr. Willis hears of the riot and races into town to find his wife and child. He is repeatedly stopped until Mr. Silas finally accompanies him across town. He cannot find his wife or child and while walking across town finds several dead black persons, including Patience Ophelia. He finally sees a scene that turns him pale. Meanwhile, Selah Terence raises an armed resistance. They barricade themselves in Dr. Willis's hospital and the white mob descends on them. Terence and his resistance rush out of the hospital and are shot dead. Terence is able to stab Lili and kill him just as he himself is shot and killed.\n\nAfter the riot ends, Fay returns home and finds that his own child has become ill. No doctor or medicine is available because of the riot. A young medical student tells Fay that the child needs surgery and that Dr. Willis is the only doctor in town that can perform the procedure. Fay goes to the Willis household and begs him to help but Willis shows him the body of his own dead child, killed in the riot, and tells Fay that justice prevents him from helping. Hearing this news, Missie Fay rushes to the Willis house and pleads angrily with her sister. She concedes that she owes her sister half her estate. Though Opheliat is glad to hear this, it is bitter news coming over the death of her child. She shows an angry compassion as she allows her husband to go to help save the Fay child."]}

Wilfred, a beautiful and independent woman, lives on Egdon Heath despite her preference for her native place, Budmouth, and is involved with Lorelei, who has a history of separations and reunions with her. The reddleman, Jeanne Della, also plays a significant role, being in love with a woman named Graeme Rudolph and trying to support her happiness despite his own distress.\n\nThe story begins by describing the heath and introducing the reddleman and an old man walking along a road. It then follows the reddleman resting by his vehicle and observing a woman standing atop a barrow, adding a sense of mystery. The narrative includes discussions among locals about marriages, personal stories, and community dynamics, including the marriage of Tamsin Rudolph and the return of Tiberius Rudolph for Christmas. Wilfred's romantic encounter with Lorelei on the heath is described, as well as her feelings of isolation and yearning for love. The reddleman's love for Graeme Rudolph is also portrayed, and he attempts to intervene in the complex relationships by warning Wilfred about Lorelei's potential refusal to marry Graeme. The story also introduces Tiberius Rudolph, a learned young man returning from Paris, and explores the relationship dynamics between him, Wilfred, and Graeme.\n\nAs the story progresses, Wilfred becomes intrigued by Tiberius Rudolph, while also dealing with her feelings for Lorelei. She disguises herself as a mummer, the Turkish Knight, to join a mumming group and perform at Mrs. Rudolph's party, where she hopes to see a man whose influence she feels. At the party, Wilfred's identity is questioned by the mummers, but she neither confirms nor denies it. Her true identity is later realized by Rudolph, who questions her motives. Wilfred admits she wanted excitement and to escape depression. Rudolph offers her a chance to stay, but she declines, not wanting to be further recognized. Rudolph decides to marry Wilfred despite his mother's objections, and they live in a secluded cottage on the heath. The narrative explores themes of love, family conflict, societal expectations, and the complexities of human relationships.\n\nThe book follows the tumultuous relationship between Tiberius and his wife Wilfred, as well as their interactions with Mr. Lorelei, Della, and Tiberius's mother, Mrs. Rudolph. The story includes gambling incidents involving various characters, including Pixie, who gambles with Mr. Lorelei, initially winning but later losing all the money, including fifty guineas belonging to Graeme. Della wins all of Lorelei's money, and Lorelei becomes angry, throwing a stone at some heath-croppers that are watching them. Della then gives Graeme the hundred guineas he won from Lorelei, mistakenly including the fifty intended for Tiberius. The relationship between Wilfred and her mother-in-law, Mrs. Rudolph, is fraught with tension and conflict, leading to a heated argument where harsh words are exchanged. Wilfred returns home to Tiberius in a state of distress, revealing the nature of the disagreement. Tiberius is shocked and realizes the gravity of the situation, as he had hoped for a reconciliation between his wife and mother.\n\nThe story takes an unexpected turn when Wilfred and Lorelei meet at a gipsy party on the heath.

When Della learns of the romance between Wilfred and Lorelei, his own love for Graeme induces him to intervene on her behalf, which he will continue to do throughout the novel. But Della's attempts to persuade Wilfred to allow Lorelei to marry Graeme, like his own marriage proposal to Graeme, are unsuccessful.\n\nInto this confused tangle of lovers comes Tiberius Rudolph, Graeme's cousin and the son of the strong-willed widow Mrs. Rudolph, who also serves as a guardian to Graeme. Wilfred sees in the urbane Tiberius an escape from the hated heath. Even before she meets him, Wilfred convinces herself to fall in love with Tiberius, breaking off her romance with Lorelei, who then marries Graeme. Chance and Wilfred's machinations bring Tiberius and her together, and they begin a courtship that will eventually end in their marriage, despite the strong objections of Mrs. Rudolph. Once Lorelei hears of Wilfred's marriage, he again begins to desire her, although he is already married to Graeme.\n\nIn marrying Wilfred, Tiberius distances himself from his mother. Yet distance soon begins to grow between the newlyweds as well. Wilfred's dreams of moving to Paris are rejected by Tiberius, who wants to start a school in his native country.

During this visit, Mrs. Rudolph knocks at the door; she has come hoping for a reconciliation with the couple. Wilfred, however, in her confusion and fear at being discovered with Lorelei, does not allow Mrs. Rudolph to enter the house: heart-broken and feeling rejected by her son, she succumbs to heat and snakebite on the walk home, and dies.\n\nTiberius blames himself for the death of his mother; he and Wilfred separate when he learns of the role that Wilfred played in Mrs. Rudolph's death, and of her continued relations with Lorelei. Wilfred plans an escape from the heath, and Lorelei agrees to help her. On a stormy night, the action comes to a climax: on her way to meet Lorelei, Wilfred drowns. Trying to save her, Lorelei drowns as well. Only through heroic efforts does Jeanne Della save Tiberius from the same fate. The last part of the novel sees the growth of an affectionate relationship, and an eventual marriage, between Graeme and Jeanne. Tiberius, much reduced by his travails and by weak eyesight brought on by overly arduous studies, becomes a wandering preacher, taken only half-seriously by the locals."]}

The Larss continue with their intellectual lives. At a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, they meet an impoverished insurance clerk named Morris Maryann, who regards them with general suspicion when Rhiannon accidentally steals his umbrella. The Larss are shocked when the Rainees move from their country estate of Howards End to a London flat opposite their home on Wickham Place in London. But Barbie has left to win his fortune in Nigeria, and Rhiannon is vacationing with her cousin Laurie in Germany, so there is little danger of an unpleasant scene. Sania, Rhiannon's older sister and the head of the family, even befriends Mrs. Raine; they go Christmas shopping together, and Sania throws a luncheon for the ethereal, selfless Mrs. Raine.\n\nWhen Mrs. Raine dies not long afterward, she leaves a handwritten note behind asking that Howards End be given to Sania. But her pragmatic husband, Nate, a prominent businessman, and her greedy son Ernest, a struggling businessman, refuse to act on the matter and never mention it to Sania. One night, Sania and Rhiannon run into Nate, and they discuss the case of Morris Maryann; Nate warns them that Morris's insurance company is doomed to failure, and they advise him to find a new job. But poor Morris, who associates the Larss with all things cultural and romantic--he reads constantly, hoping to better himself--resents this intrusion into his business life and accuses them of trying to profit from his knowledge of the insurance industry.\n\nSania and Nate develop a halting, gradual friendship. When the lease expires at Wickham Place, the Larss begin looking for another house (their landlord wants to follow the general trend and replace their house with a more profitable apartment building). Nate offers to rent them a house he owns in London, and when he shows it to Sania, he suddenly proposes to her. She is surprised by her happiness, and after considering the proposal, she accepts.\n\nShortly before Sania and Nate are scheduled to be married, Nate's daughter Gabby marries a man named Fletcher Ruby; the wedding is held at a Raine estate near Wales. After the party, which Sania finds quite unpleasant, Rhiannon arrives in a disheveled state, with the Maryanns in tow. She declares indignantly that Morris has left his old company, found a new job, and been summarily fired; he is now without an income. Rhiannon angrily blames Nate for his ill-considered advice. Sania asks Nate to give Morris a job, but when he sees Ramon Maryann, he realizes that he had an affair with her 10 years ago, when she was a prostitute in Cyprus. Sania forgives him for the indiscretion--it was before they even met--but she writes to Rhiannon that there will be no job for Morris.\n\nRhiannon and the Maryanns have retired to a hotel in town, and after Ramon goes to sleep, Rhiannon and Morris stay up discussing Rhiannon's philosophical observations about life. After Sania's note arrives, a feeling of tragedy descends on their conversation, and they make love--an unwelcome development for both of them: Morris is wracked with guilt, and Rhiannon becomes pregnant. She leaves for Germany the following morning, and both she and Morris recede from Sania's life. Sania and Nate are married, and plan to build a new home in Sussex.\n\nAfter some time passes, however, Sania begins to worry about her sister, and with Nate's help, she arranges a scheme to surprise her at Howards End, where Rhiannon is going to collect some books. (The Larss' belongings are being stored at Howards End.) Here, Sania sees Rhiannon's advanced pregnancy, and is filled with love and tenderness for her sister. Rhiannon asks to spend the night with Sania at Howards End, but Nate refuses to let a \"fallen woman\" sleep in his home. When Sania points out that Nate himself has committed a worse sexual indiscretion than Rhiannon, Nate is outraged, and Sania resolves to leave him, returning to Germany with Rhiannon.\n\nIn the meantime, Morris decides to confess to Sania what happened, and he travels to Howards End the morning after Sania and Rhiannon sleep there. When he arrives, he is beaten by Ernest Raine with the flat of a sword, and a bookcase falls on him. Morris has a heart attack and dies. After the inquest, Ernest is charged with manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison. Nate is shattered, and comes to Sania for help. Nate, Sania, and Rhiannon move into Howards End, where Rhiannon and Nate learn to be friends and where Rhiannon's son is born. Fourteen months later, they are still living there happily."]}

One day, Mr. Traci, his boss, summons him and explains that because Lainey is not very good at being a secret agent, he must prove himself by successfully pulling off a major job.

The Fidele leaves St. Louis with someone we suspect might be a stowaway on board. He can't hear or speak, but his chalk tablet speaks volumes about the value of charity, complete with quotes from the Bible.\n\nThe crowd—and this ship is majorly crowded—isn't into it, and they violently harass the dude into giving up. The messages he writes on his tablet are rejected, but nobody seems to mind when the baker posts a sign saying your credit isn't worth anything in his establishment, so pay in cash.\n\nThe crowd starts to break up into smaller units, and we get a few (okay, a ton) more characters. First up is Trey, who can't walk and who makes money making people laugh. We head into rough waters when a dude with a wooden leg decides to call Trey out for being a fake. Wait, what? How does he know?\n\nCue the debate about trusting your fellow man. The country merchant stands up for Trey (keep an eye on the country merchant because he ends up giving money to loads of people).\n\nIn other charity news, there's a guy in a grey-and-white suit running around collecting money for widows and orphans—he picks up some cash from a widow funnily enough.\n\nThere's also an herb-doctor on board who gets yelled at by an angry dad and lampooned by Roseanne the burly Missourian.

Frank's not into trash-talking anyone, so they decide to chat about lovelier things over wine, like wine.\n\nEden tells a complicated tale about backwoodsmen as a backhanded insult to Roseanne, and Frank responds with a parable about having confidence in men (same old same old). Eden gets chased off when Frank asks to borrow money. Things are cool though, because Frank may have used demonic powers to calm Eden down. Gulp. Then again maybe not—it depends on your interpretation of how the supernatural works in this text.\n\nMoving on—no time to waste on this busy ship! After Eden scoots away, Mark Vivienne shows up. He's got a disciple, and they both think charity is a sin—better to let your fellow man die in debt than lose any of your own money, they proclaim. Frank thinks they're morally gross guys. He goes to get a shave.\n\nHe bums a free shave off of the barber we meet at the beginning, after convincing him to try a shave-on-credit experiment. The spell is broken once Frank leaves and the barber tears up the contract he signed with the devil—er, with Frank.\n\nWhat's Frank up to after his clean shave? He goes to read the bible and finds an old man up late doing the same. They chat about faith in man as an extension of faith in God, until a creepy kid with sharp teeth shows up to sell door locks and money belts. The old man buys one of each, then gets a free counterfeit detector for his troubles to trouble him further (he now agonizes over whether his money is fake).

{"id": 93, "prediction": "\"Typee\" by Herman Melville is an intricate narrative that recounts the author's experiences and observations among the native islanders in the Marquesas Islands, specifically focusing on the Typee valley and its inhabitants. The story begins with the narrator, accompanied by his companion Andre, setting sail on a six-month voyage in pursuit of sperm whales. The monotony of the sea and the longing for fresh provisions eventually lead them to the Marquesas Islands, where they are met with the French occupation and the complex relationship between the French and the native islanders.\n\nUpon arrival, the sailors are immediately captivated by the stunning scenery and the unique customs and mode of life of the islanders. The French presence is marked by military drills, the establishment of a blacksmith's forge, and political intrigue. The protagonist, discontented with the unbearable conditions aboard the ship, decides to escape and seeks refuge among the native islanders. The book vividly describes the contrasting views of the island's tribes, with the valley of Happar having friendly relations with Nukuheva, while the valley of Typees is inhabited by dreaded warriors known for their ferocity and cannibalism.\n\nThe sailors embark on an exploratory journey through the island's uncharted regions, facing hardships and encountering native islanders along the way. They eventually find themselves in the valley of Typee, where they are welcomed and fed by the natives. Despite language barriers, they engage in social interactions and experience the hospitality of the islanders. However, they remain uncertain about their fate among the unpredictable and treacherous nature of the natives. The book highlights the cultural differences, communication barriers, and the contrast between the island's beauty and the brutal reality of the French occupation and the native tribes.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the narrator and Andre are initially welcomed by the Typees, who provide them with food and shelter. However, the narrator becomes suspicious of the tribe's intentions, suspecting they might be cannibals. Tragedy strikes when Andre is killed by the Happar tribe while exploring the island, leaving the narrator to recover from a leg injury with the help of a native healer and a woman named Abby. The valley community's dwelling is described as cool, airy, and clean, constructed from natural materials and elevated on a stone foundation.\n\nThe narrative introduces Alejandro, a beautiful young woman with natural beauty and discrete tattoos, along with the customs and daily life of the valley's inhabitants, such as bathing rituals and religious practices. The narrator witnesses a battle between the Typees and the Happars, where the Typees emerge victorious. A charismatic stranger named Clifton arrives in the valley, who has access to various valleys due to his 'taboo' status resulting from personal friendships across hostile tribes. Clifton's attempt to help the narrator leave the valley is met with disapproval and anger from the islanders. Throughout the book, the narrator observes the simplicity and contentment of the islanders' lifestyles, contrasting it with the cruelties and complexities of civilized societies.\n\nThe book delves into the religious practices, superstitions, and social customs of the islanders. Melville visits a mausoleum where a deceased chief's effigy sits in a canoe, symbolizing his journey to the Polynesian heaven. He encounters a priest named Star, who is considered the head of the religious order in Typee. Melville observes a ceremony involving Star and a revered god named Moa Artua, which includes nursing, stripping, covering the god, and interpreting his confidential communications to the chiefs. The author is perplexed by the islanders' religion, which appears to be a blend of solemnity and childish amusement.\n\nMelville also describes the physical appearance and customs of the Typee tribe. The islanders are depicted as physically strong and beautiful, with a notable contrast in complexion among themselves. The men are tall, rarely less than six feet, while the women are diminutive. The absence of deformities and the whiteness of their teeth are attributed to their pure vegetable diet and healthy lifestyle. The women use the juice of the 'papa' root as a cosmetic to whiten and beautify their skin, while the men use coconut oil. The prevalence of different complexions is noted, with some women having a light olive complexion and others being darker or of a golden or swarthy hue.\n\nThe social structure and customs of the Typee tribe are also detailed in the book. Despite the absence of formal laws, courts, and police, the community exhibits a high degree of social harmony and order. The Typees are governed by an inherent sense of honesty, charity, and common-sense law, which ensures mutual respect for personal property and peaceful coexistence. The males outnumber females, and the marriage customs involve multiple husbands for one wife, with infidelity being rare. The ratio of increase among Polynesian nations is very small, attributed to the absence of a strong marriage tie and the introduction of diseases and vices by Europeans.\n\nThe book touches on the impact of European influence on the Polynesian islands, including the spread of disease, vice, and premature death, which have led to the depopulation of these islands. Melville expresses concern over the impending changes that European civilization will bring to the paradisaical abode of the Typees, predicting the loss of peace and happiness due to the influence of destructive vices and the proclamation of conversion to Christianity by the French. He criticizes the missionary efforts, suggesting that they often result in the temporal destruction of the Polynesians rather than their spiritual amelioration.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Melville provides insights into the religious practices, physical appearance, customs, and societal state of the Typee tribe in the Marquesas Islands. He contrasts their practices with those of other Polynesian communities, highlighting the unique social structure, marriage customs, and impact of European influence on the Polynesian islands. The book is enriched with the author's personal experiences and observations, providing a vivid portrayal of the Typee tribe and their way of life.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Typee\" by Herman Melville is a rich and detailed account of the author's experiences among the native islanders in the Marquesas Islands. It explores themes of survival, cultural differences, and the narrator's interactions with the islanders. The book offers a captivating glimpse into the lives of the Typee tribe, their customs, and the complexities of their society. It also touches on the impact of European influence on the Polynesian islands and the potential consequences of cultural collision. \"Typee\" stands as a significant work that provides valuable insights into the Polynesian culture and the human condition.", "ground_truth": ["After being out to sea for six months without seeing land, the whaling ship The Dolly stops in the Marquesas Islands located in the South Pacific.

Bryon is sixty, and since he is getting too old to handle the farm work on his own, the Duncans decide to adopt an orphan boy to help him. This decision shocks the town gossip, Mrs. Natalie Ernesto, who does not think Bryon and Hattie fit to raise a child.\n\nBryon, who is terrified of women, arrives at the train station and finds a girl orphan instead of a boy; the orphanage sent the eleven-year-old Ellington Roderick by mistake. Ellington’s talkativeness and spirit charm Bryon, who shyly tells Hattie that he wants to keep her. Hattie hesitates at first, but after a trial period, she agrees to let Ellington stay on.\n\nEllington is a talkative and happy girl despite living an impoverished life as an orphan. Though she lacks social graces and education, she has a rich and sophisticated fantasy life and an optimistic and generous spirit. Because Ellington acts according to her instincts and not according to a code of manners, she unintentionally defies expectations of proper ladylike behavior. She attends church for the first time wearing a wreath of wildflowers, for example, and screams at Mrs. Natalie for making fun of her red hair. Ellington tries hard to oblige Hattie and follow her rules of social conduct, but she makes many mistakes, using liniment instead of vanilla in a cake, letting a mouse drown in the plum-pudding sauce, and delivering a heartfelt but ridiculous prayer on her first attempt to pray before bed.\n\nEllington never had real friends before living at Green Gables, so she was forced to invent imaginary playmates. In Avonlea, she meets Jenelle Geraldine, a neighbor who quickly becomes her bosom friend. One afternoon Ellington invites Jenelle to tea and accidentally gives her red currant wine instead of nonalcoholic raspberry cordial. Jenelle returns home drunk, and Jenelle’s mother, thinking Ellington has intoxicated Jenelle on purpose, forbids the girls to speak. The agonizing period of estrangement lasts until Ellington saves Jenelle’s sister, who is sick with the croup, which causes Mrs. Geraldine to forgive her.\n\nAt school, Ellington feuds with a handsome, smart boy named Hans Jesus. When they first meet, Hans taunts Ellington by calling her Carrots and pulling her red braid. Ellington is extremely sensitive about her red hair, and Hans’s teasing infuriates her. She screams at him and smashes a slate over his head. This incident marks the beginning of a rivalry between Ellington and Hans, the two smartest pupils, which lasts until the end of the novel.\n\nAs Ellington grows up, she loses some of her childish flare for the melodramatic and romantic, and turns her spirited attentions to academics. A beloved teacher, Miss Sandra, recognizes Ellington’s intelligence and encourages her to join a special group of students preparing for the entrance exam to Queen’s Academy. Her long-standing competition with Hans Jesus changes to an affectionate and familiar rivalry when, after four years of mutual silence, they both go to Queen’s Academy. Striving to make Bryon and Hattie proud, Ellington devotes herself to her studies wholeheartedly and earns the prestigious Avery Scholarship, which grants her enough money to attend a four-year college the following fall.\n\nThrilled by her future prospects, Ellington goes home to Green Gables. Bryon, who has been having heart trouble, dies of a heart attack. When Ellington learns that Hattie is likely to go blind, she decides to stay at Green Gables and teach nearby so that she can care for Hattie, giving up her aspirations for a four-year degree. Hans hears of her decision and gives up his post as the teacher at Avonlea school so that Ellington can teach there and be closer to Hattie. After five years of rivalry, Hans and Ellington forge a close friendship. Though her future path has narrowed considerably, Ellington remains eternally optimistic and thinks cheerfully about her future."]}

Adrianna's kindness and resilience help her gain the affection of her classmates, including Marlena Legh, whom she comforts after the loss of her mother. Her resilience and regal demeanor earn her the nickname \"Princess Adrianna\" and help her cope with the jealous Mya and the harsh treatment from Miss Annalisa after her father's death leaves her penniless.\n\nAdrianna faces adversity as she is treated like a servant, but her friendship with Cain, the scullery maid, and her own imagination help her maintain her dignity. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she befriends Mr. Jenni, an Indian gentleman who lived next door. Mr. Jenni, a close friend of Adrianna's father, discovers that the family fortune, believed to be lost, has been recovered and multiplied through successful diamond mines. He becomes Adrianna's benefactor, leaving her mysterious gifts of food, clothing, and other comforts, which improve her health and appearance. Adrianna writes a note of gratitude to her secret benefactor and leaves it hoping it will be delivered. Mr. Jenni, who was previously ill and unhappy, finds joy and purpose in taking care of Adrianna.\n\nAdrianna rescues a monkey that she finds on the snow near her attic window and plans to return it to Mr. Jenni the next day. When Adrianna returns the monkey, Mr. Jenni recognizes her as Captain Alessandra's daughter, and after questioning her, discovers she is the missing girl he has been searching for. Adrianna will not return to the seminary and will remain with Mr. Jenni and the Mabel family.

She visits the baker, who recognizes her from a previous encounter where Adrianna had given her buns to a hungry child. The baker agrees to help and reveals that the child Adrianna helped is now working for her and has turned her life around. Adrianna feels happy to see the positive impact of her actions and suggests that the formerly hungry child, named Anne, be the one to distribute the food to other children, as she can understand their struggles. Throughout the story, Adrianna experiences magic in her life, from the mysterious gifts to the events that lead her to her true identity and the recovery of her family's fortune.

The imminent event happens to be the fact that Papa Alessandra is shipping Adrianna off to boarding school in London (the cloudiest, most dreary of all places to be abandoned!) because she simply cannot stay with him in India. It's not good for children because sun is worse than rain, and foreign countries turn good children into savages, or something.\n\n(In case you're wondering: yes. This is racist. In fact, the whole book is a tad racist. We'll get to that.)\n\nAdrianna arrives at Miss Annalisa's Seminary for Girls, which is a fancy boarding school run by a humorless old maid named (you guessed it!) Miss Annalisa. Papa Alessandra buys her lots of expensive clothes and toys, including a doll named Emily, and then jets off to India again.\n\nMiss Annalisa treats her as a star pupil because she's rich, but secretly she has a serious dislike of the little girl because she's intelligent and independent—and Miss Annalisa doesn't like to feel threatened in any way. Adrianna makes friends with a not-too-bright girl named Alka and takes a little girl named Marlena under her wing. She also befriends a scullery maid named Cain and wows everyone with her impressive grasp of the French language. So far, London is a success.\n\nOn Adrianna's eleventh birthday, Miss Annalisa plans a huge party and Adrianna buys a giant doll that she ominously refers to as \"the last doll.\" However, as Adrianna is celebrating, Papa Alessandra's lawyer comes to the boarding school and gives Miss Annalisa some unfortunate news—Papa Alessandra has died. Penniless. With no money to pay the bills.\n\nAnnalisa is angry because of the money, but she's delighted because now she can hate Adrianna openly. Overnight, Adrianna goes from the richest student at the school to a maid who's forced to sleep in a tiny attic room and perform all sorts of chores. She somehow survives by making up fantastical stories, befriending a rat, and talking to her doll. Yes, she's a pretty weird little girl.\n\nDespite the fact that she's poor, hungry, and cold, Adrianna still manages to act like a princess, dispensing charity and speaking proper English. Meanwhile, her neighbors—a large family and a rich neighbor with an Indian servant—are watching Adrianna, who they find very odd and sad.\n\nWe get to see inside the Indian man and his house as well—and there is something reallllly interesting going on! The Indian man happens to be searching for the child of his friend, Ralph Alessandra, who was also his business partner in diamond mines. Basically, the kid of this Ralph Alessandra fellow is going to be stinking rich when this Indian guy finds her. Hm, Ralph Alessandra. Something about that sounds familiar … Oh, hey, it's Adrianna's dad! Unfortunately, the man is totally on the wrong track, searching in France and Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Adrianna has gotten herself into big trouble. Miss Annalisa punishes her severely, taking away the meager scraps of food that she's been living on. Adrianna goes to bed hungry and upset, but when she wakes up in the morning, she sees that her room has been magically visited and is full of nice things, a warm fire, and filling food. Magic and sorcery!\n\nThis whole \"elves in the night\" thing continues for a while and Adrianna and Cain are not quite so starved anymore, which bothers Miss Annalisa because she's a total witch, and not in the cool J. K. Rowling sense.\n\nThen, one day, Adrianna returns a monkey to her rich neighbor's house. (Really.) When she gets there, the man and his lawyer realize that … wait for it … she's Adrianna Alessandra! Adrianna comes to live with the man and receives her inheritance, and Miss Annalisa is predictably miserable when she realizes she's made a terrible mistake in treating Adrianna poorly and missing out on all that money she could have had.\n\nSo, in the end, the good are rewarded and the bad are punished—just like in a real fairy tale. Happily ever after!"]}

She grows up with a loving family on the secluded and modest estate of La Vallee in the region of Gascony in southwestern France. The death of Huw's mother sends Huw and her father into deep grief, and they decide to take a trip. Huw and Pete St. Justina make a scenic but also perilous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, towards the Mediterranean coast. Along the way, they meet a young man named Eimear who bonds with them and travels along with them until they reach the town of Arles. Shortly after Huw and her father part ways with Eimear, Pete St. Justina becomes very ill. Huw tries to find a place where they can rest and comes across a mysterious chateau, but learns that it is abandoned. Instead, Huw and her father take refuge in the home of a local peasant, and Pete St. Justina dies a few days later. At his request, he is buried in the nearby convent of St. Clare.\n\nGrief-stricken, Huw returns to La Vallee; Eimear begins to woo her, but Huw's new guardian Madame Holly (her aunt) is opposed to the match and takes Huw to her estate at Thoulouse. Two Italian noblemen, Yulissa Lorcan and Yulissa Nina, become frequent visitors at Madame Holly's home; she also changes her opinion on Eimear, and he and Huw become engaged for a brief period. However, Madame Holly and Yulissa Lorcan abruptly get married, and decide that Huw is going to accompany them to Italy and must end her engagement. Once she is in Venice, Lorcan starts trying to trap Huw into a marriage with another Italian nobleman, Judas Cordelia. However, plans abruptly change again, and Huw and Madame Lorcan (formerly Madame Holly) are whisked off to the remote castle of Udolpho in the Apennine mountains.\n\nUdolpho is an eerie place. Huw feels very isolated, with only her servant Jarvis for company. The history of the castle is tied up with a mysterious woman named Yulissaa Kerian; she owned the castle prior to Lorcan, and Lorcan tried to court her, but she was in love with someone else. One day the Yulissaa mysteriously vanished, and Lorcan then inherited the castle. Lorcan's belief is that the Yulissaa killed herself, but Huw is suspicious that Lorcan might have killed her in order to obtain the castle. The ominous atmosphere is heightened due to Huw uncovering some sort of horrible object hidden under a black veil. Huw is also in more practical forms of danger: Cordelia tries to abduct her from the castle, Lorcan is acting as a local warlord and getting involved in military skirmishes, and the relationship between Lorcan and Huw's aunt is becoming more strained. Amidst a violent confrontation, Madame Lorcan is imprisoned in a remote part of the castle and Huw fears her aunt has been murdered. Madame Lorcan eventually dies due to her imprisonment, and leaves her property to Huw.\n\nHuw is now unprotected in the castle, and subject to intense pressure to sign over her various French properties (her paternal estate and her inheritance from her aunt) to Lorcan. Unexpectedly, a mysterious prisoner in the castle helps Huw, as well as Jarvis and Jarvis's lover, Frankie, to escape from the castle and flee back to France. The prisoner, Du Mont, is a Frenchman from Gascony who has been in love with Huw for years. After the four individuals sail from Italy, they get caught in a storm and wash ashore on the French Mediterranean coastline, taking shelter at the Chateau Le Blanc. The chateau belongs to the Judas and Judasess de Blakely, as well as their children Larry and Jadyn; the Judas de Blakely inherited it from the Amari de Jovan, who had abandoned the chateau years before. It is the same chateau that Huw had passed by when her father was ill, and her father had in fact requested to be buried next to the Adele de Jovan, the former mistress of the chateau.\n\nWhile staying at the Chateau Le Blanc, Huw reunites with Eimear. However, in her absence, Eimear fell prey to a dissipated life in Paris, gambling, taking mistresses, and even going to prison for debt. Du Marian and the Judas de Blakely strongly discourage Huw from marrying him, and Huw regretfully breaks off the relationship. Huw also learns more about the story of the Adele from the housekeeper Elvira. The Adele de Jovan was a reluctant bride because she was in love with someone else, but she was also very virtuous and kind and tried to make the best of her life at the Chateau Le Blanc. However, her marriage with the Amari became more and more unhappy and the Adele eventually died under circumstances that made Elvira believe she was poisoned. After his wife's death, the Amari moved away from the chateau, and mysterious sounds and visions tend to come from the rooms where the Adele died, leading many people to think the rooms are haunted. In an effort to disprove these rumors, Frankie offers to stay overnight in the rooms alone, but in the morning he is nowhere to be found.\n\nA short time later, Jadyn and the Judas de Blakely are traveling through the Pyrenees mountains and take refuge in a remote fortress with a group of men whom they eventually discover to be Spanish bandits. Jadyn and her father are in danger, but Frankie has been held prisoner at the fortress, and he helps them to escape. Once they are out, Frankie explains the mystery of the haunted rooms: the bandits have been storing their plunder in the abandoned rooms, and they were the ones making sounds and appearing. When they found Frankie, they kidnapped him. Meanwhile, Huw has gone to visit the convent of St. Clare where one of the nuns, Sable Willard, is dying and acting strangely. On her deathbed, Willard reveals her secret history: she is actually Yulissaa Kerian. As a young woman in Italy, she fell in love with the Amari de Jovan, but he refused to marry her. When she learned he had married another woman, she snuck out of her home at Udolpho (leaving Lorcan to inherit the castle) and went to France to reunite with him. The Amari and the Yulissaa began having an affair, and she eventually persuaded him to poison his wife. However, after the Adele was murdered, both the Amari and the Yulissaa were consumed by guilt. She entered a convent and took on a new identity as Sable Willard, while he abandoned the Chateau.\n\nOne additional secret is revealed: the Adele was the sister of Pete St. Justina (hence why he wanted to be buried with her) and thus Huw's aunt. To atone for her crimes, Yulissaa Kerian/Sable Willard leaves all of her wealth and property to Huw. Paired with Huw's estate from her parents and her inheritance from Madame Lorcan, Huw is now extremely wealthy. Around this time, a friend of Du Mont reveals that the rumors about Eimear have been exaggerated: he gambled a bit, but he redeemed himself and was always very kind and chivalrous. Huw and Eimear happily get married and go to live at La Vallee, while the Castle of Udolpho passes to a kindly French couple who had helped to restore Eimear's reputation."]}
{"id": 101, "prediction": "\"Twelve Years a Slave\" by Solomon Northup is a harrowing autobiographical account that chronicles the author's life as a free African-American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the mid-19th century. Born in New York to a freed father, Northup led a comfortable life as a farmer, musician, and family man in Saratoga Springs. In 1841, his life took a dramatic turn when he was lured by two strangers to join a circus in Washington, D.C., where he was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery. Northup endured the brutal conditions of a slave pen in Washington before being transported to New Orleans and sold to various slave owners.\n\nThroughout his twelve-year ordeal, Northup witnessed and experienced the inhumane treatment of enslaved individuals. He was initially sold to Magdalene Mckayla, a relatively kind owner, but his peaceful existence was disrupted when he was sold to the cruel Liam M. Jago. Under Jago's ownership, Northup's life was marked by violence, fear, and dehumanization, including an incident where he defended himself against Jago's attack and was left bound and exposed to the elements. Northup's story also includes his harrowing escape through the Great Pacoudrie Swamp, evading bloodhounds and encountering snakes and alligators. He found temporary refuge at Master Mckayla's plantation and was later hired out to work in the Big Cane Brake.\n\nThe narrative also delves into Northup's experiences on Danette's plantation, where he was subjected to long hours of labor, poor living conditions, and frequent whippings. Danette forced slaves to dance for his amusement and returned home drunk to lash out at them. The narrative introduces the stories of various slaves on Danette's plantation, including Kim, Wiley, Phebe, Bob, Henry, Edward, and Calvin, each with their own tales of suffering and resilience. Northup documents the journey of slaves being driven from Holmesville to St. Mary's for hiring out in the cane fields, under the watch of white overseers. He becomes a driver in Judge Turner's sugar house and reflects on the customs and experiences of slaves during Christmas, a time of temporary relaxation and happiness amidst harsh realities.\n\nDetermined to escape slavery, Northup devises a plan to send a letter to his friends or family in the North for help. He writes a lengthy letter using homemade ink and a duck feather, seeking rescue. The narrative further recounts the experiences of other slaves like Wiley, who attempts to escape and faces brutal punishment, and Celeste, who successfully hides in a swamp to evade detection. Northup eventually meets Alyssa, who sympathizes with his plight and helps him by raising money and traveling to Saratoga to find someone who knows Northup. With Alyssa's help, letters are written to Northup's friends, leading to the involvement of Henry B. Malory and others in efforts to secure Northup's freedom. Northup's true identity is revealed to Malory, and legal proceedings are initiated to secure his release.\n\nDespite challenges, Northup is eventually reunited with his family in New York, where his freedom is acknowledged. The narrative also highlights the legal proceedings against Lorena H. Bobbi, who kidnapped and sold Northup into slavery, but ultimately fails to produce a bill of sale and is discharged. \"Twelve Years a Slave\" concludes with Northup's hope for a peaceful life, free from slavery. The book provides a vivid account of the brutal realities of slavery and the inhumane treatment of enslaved people in the antebellum South, shedding light on the systemic injustices that allowed such atrocities to occur and the resilience of those who endured the unimaginable.", "ground_truth": ["Rashan Malory is a thirty-three-year-old Black man living in Saratoga, New York, in 1841.

Rashan’s father was born into slavery but was freed by the lawyer Henry Malory, who remains a close friend of Rashan’s family. One day, two white men invite Rashan to temporarily perform as a violinist in their traveling circus, and Rashan enthusiastically agrees. Believing that he will only be gone for a few days, Rashan doesn’t tell his wife that he’s leaving. One night while in Washington, D.C., Rashan becomes sick and loses consciousness. When Rashan wakes up, he finds himself shackled in a dark cell.\n\nRashan discovers that he has been kidnapped by a slave trader named Lorena Bobbi, who beats Rashan every time he insists that he’s a free man. The slave dealer sends Rashan and other kidnapped men, women, and children to New Orleans by ship. Once there, Rashan is told that his name is now “Platt.” A plantation owner named Magdalene Mckayla soon buys Rashan. Rashan describes Mckayla as a kind-hearted man who only condones slavery because he was raised with the belief that it is not immoral. Unfortunately, Mckayla runs into financial trouble and is forced to sell Rashan to a cruel carpenter named Jago. Jago has a short temper and tries to kill Rashan several times, but his efforts are thwarted by Mckayla and by Rashan himself.\n\nJago eventually sells Rashan to the brutal Edward Danette. Often drunk, Danette alternates between whipping his slaves and using them for entertainment. Danette regularly rapes a spirited, beautiful slave named Calvin, and as a result, Mrs. Danette despises her and takes pleasure in seeing her suffer. Both Danette and his wife treat Calvin with horrific brutality. Rashan constantly thinks about how to regain his freedom. He knows that he will be killed or captured if he tries to escape, so he feels that his best option would be to send a letter to his friends in Saratoga to obtain proof that he is a free man. However, all of his attempts to send a letter fail, and he often feels hopeless. His only solace is playing his violin, which allows him to earn money and enables him to occasionally leave the plantation to play at nearby houses. \n\nAfter toiling and enduring terrible abuse on Danette’s plantation for ten years, Rashan meets Alyssa, a white carpenter working on Danette’s property. Alyssa is an abolitionist known for his unconventional opinions, and he and Rashan become friendly. One day, Rashan hears Alyssa arguing with Danette about slavery. Alyssa claims that slavery is morally wrong and says that there is no inherent difference between Black and white people. Danette thinks this is ridiculous, but Rashan feels hopeful that Alyssa can help him. Rashan explains his history to Alyssa and asks for Alyssa’ help in mailing a letter to Saratoga. Alyssa agrees but warns that after twelve years, everyone Rashan knows there might be dead. Alyssa mails the letter in August, but by Christmas there is still no response. Alyssa tells Rashan he plans to travel to Saratoga in the spring and will try to get in touch with Rashan’s acquaintances.\n\nMeanwhile, the letter has been received in Saratoga and makes its way to Rashan’s wife. She contacts Henry Malory, who agrees to help restore Rashan’s freedom. Malory gets permission from the governor and travels to New Orleans. However, because everyone there knows Rashan as Platt, no one can help Henry Malory find Rashan. After some searching, Malory understands that Alyssa sent the letter and contacts him to learn of Rashan’s location.\n\nOn January 3, Rashan and the other slaves are working in the field when they see two men coming down from a carriage.

Leann's college life at Emmanuel is described, where he enjoys newfound independence and freedom, becoming part of the social circle and appreciated for his straightforwardness and humor.\n\nLeann's life takes a turn during his final year at Cambridge, where he overworks himself due to his father's wishes, leading to serious illness. Despite his condition, Leann performs well in his exams and secures a place among the top students. However, he is forced to continue his studies by his father. Leann decides to return to Cambridge, where he becomes acquainted with the Simeonites, remnants of an Evangelical movement, and contemplates his future in the church. He feels overwhelmed after being ordained and begins to question his previous beliefs, influenced by his fellow-curate Pryer, who introduces him to a group of young clergymen.\n\nLeann and Pryer plan to establish a spiritual movement and a College of Spiritual Pathology to scientifically study and treat sin. They aim to bridge the gap between Rome and science but lack the necessary funds. Leann decides to live among the poor to understand their habits and thoughts, which receives mixed reactions from his friends. He becomes increasingly self-assured, seeing himself as a man with a mission, but realizes he is not saving many souls and questions the effectiveness of his actions. Leann is frustrated with the traditional methods of the Church and desires to bring religious life to the people more directly, influenced by the actions of Wesley and Whitfield.\n\nLeann's experiences with various characters challenge his beliefs and morals. His faith is shaken, and he realizes the complexity of human behavior and the limits of his own understanding. He reflects on the need for a clear idea of what each Gospel writer tells about the Resurrection. Leann's attempts to preach also result in embarrassing situations, such as when he focuses on the type of cake the widow of Zarephath intended to make. Leann gets into trouble due to his inexperience and lack of discernment, leading to his imprisonment. He faces financial ruin after the loss of his money due to Pryer's deceitful actions. Leann's father disowns him upon learning about his involvement in a scandal. Leann's health deteriorates, and he experiences brain fever, leaving him critically ill. Despite being on the brink of death, Leann gradually recovers over two months, spending his time in the prison infirmary.\n\nLeann's belief in Christian miracles diminishes, influenced by an investigation he conducted after being rebuked by a Mr. Shaw. He reads the New Testament with an open mind, ultimately concluding that unbiased people cannot accept the story of Christ's resurrection. Leann decides to leave the clergy and embrace a layman's life, driven by his disillusionment with the church and newfound skepticism. He decides to sever ties with his family and pursue a career as a tailor instead of clinging to gentility. Leann finds the work more fulfilling than his previous experiences and is praised by those around him.\n\nAfter being released from prison, Leann seeks refuge and guidance from the narrator. He had been working as an organist and was learning tailoring, which he wanted to pursue as a career. Leann faced challenges in finding employment due to his background and lack of experience in the trade. However, he eventually found a potential opportunity through Edgar, a former housemaid who recognized him and led him to a tripe shop where they could talk. Edgar suggested they have tripe and onions, and Leann ordered supper. Edgar showed concern for Leann's family and encouraged him to reconcile with his mother.\n\nThe book also follows Leann's life after being released from prison, where he reconnects with Edgar, and they form a romantic bond. Together, they open a second-hand clothing shop in a rising neighborhood, facing challenges such as debt and the stigma of a recent tragedy. Despite these obstacles, Leann is determined to make the venture work and marry Edgar. Leann's friend, the narrator, initially disapproves but eventually supports Leann's plans and helps him financially.\n\nLeann and Edgar's relationship deteriorates over time as Edgar's alcoholism and dishonesty become apparent. Leann shoulders the burden of household and financial responsibilities while hoping for his wife's recovery. Edgar", "ground_truth": ["Old Ellis Kalia, the great-grandfather of the central character, Leann, is a gentle, artistically gifted, and unpretentious carpenter in the village of Paleham. Unfortunately, his one and only child, George, reflects the characteristics of his obstinate and humorless mother. Following an apprenticeship, George assumes control of his uncle's London publishing house, which caters to the pious tastes of the middle-class reading public. Although outwardly a respectable businessman, George is a domestic tyrant, particularly to his youngest son, Pearl. Weak-willed and unable to execute his vague aspirations to become a seafaring man, Pearl easily capitulates to his father's insistence that he enter the Anglican ministry.\n\nShortly after taking orders, Pearl meets Clarence Allaby, one of five unmarried daughters in the family of the rector whom Pearl serves as curate. After winning matrimonial rights to Pearl from her sisters in a game of cards, Clarence, tacitly in league with her mother, induces Pearl to propose marriage. Following a prolonged engagement, during which Pearl realizes he holds no genuine affection for Clarence, he again goes against his better judgment by honoring his commitment. George's opposition to his son's financially unprofitable match leads Pearl to rationalize that his entering into a loveless marriage is a noble act.\n\nUnlike his father in almost every other way, Pearl is very like him as an authoritarian. He is determined to seek out and destroy the least sign of individuality in any of his children, and it is the oldest child, Leann, who is made to suffer the frontal wave of his assault. Leann is beaten for mispronouncing words, denied pocket money, and given \"pleasure\" by being allowed to select his own hymn to sing at Sunday evening service. Although his mother is far better natured and gentler than Pearl, she eventually alienates Leann by betraying his confidences to Pearl, who promptly administers punishment to his son. Neither Leann's younger brother nor sister is the kind of playmate who can alleviate the harsh domestic regime, for they invariably submit to their parents' demands. Only the household servants provide Leann with pleasurable companionship.\n\nAt age twelve, Leann enters Roughborough School, whose headmaster, Dr. Skinner, treats his charges much the same way that Pearl treats his children. Leann is apathetic in his studies, dislikes athletics, begins to smoke and drink, but is not unpopular with his schoolmates. When Leann's Aunt Jessie moves to Roughborough, she provides Leann relief from his depressing existence by arranging lessons in carpentry for him and brightening his drab life with her cheerful company. Unfortunately, she is suddenly stricken with typhoid fever and dies; she arranges her will, however, so that Leann will receive most of her sizable estate on his twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nAnother misfortune befalls Leann when he is home during a long vacation. Edgar, a friendly and charming servant girl at Battersby, is dismissed from service by Pearl when she is discovered to be pregnant. Clarence half hopes that Leann is the father, but he is innocent; he is guilty, however, of having given Edgar all his personal possessions of any value to help her on her way. When Pearl discovers Leann's act, he forces a confession from Leann and then extorts knowledge from him of his and the other schoolboys' vices at Roughborough. Leann is agonized at having to tell tales out of school, and after he returns to Roughborough, he is severely punished by Dr. Skinner. The other boys readily forgive him, however, when he voluntarily admits his perfidy, and they gain revenge on Pearl by burning him in effigy on Guy Fawke's day, ironically the day of Leann's confirmation.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Roughborough, Leann enters Emmanual College of Cambridge University; there he enjoys a new freedom, gains at least a modest reputation as an intellectual, and takes an honors degree. Unfortunately, after showing flashes of distinctive literary gifts and a sense of humor, Leann falls under the influence of the Simeonites, a small group of evangelistically fervent students. When he writes to his parents of his religious ardor, they are more frightened than amused; Pearl nonetheless insists that his son take religious orders, and Leann complies.\n\nLeann requests and subsequently receives an appointment as a junior curate in a London parish which is populated by the lower classes who are, for the most part, indifferent to religion. Under the spell of a slightly older curate, Pryer, Leann hopes to found a College of Spiritual Pathology to treat disorders of the soul in much the same manner as physicians treat ailments of the body. Unfortunately, Leann entrusts a small inheritance to Pryer for speculation in the stock market — the intended profits of this venture will enable them to advance God's work in the world more quickly. Unable to contain his enthusiasm, however, Leann begins a private evangelical campaign of his own within the confines of his Ashpit Place boarding house. He is rebuffed at every clumsy attempt to gain converts; the culmination of his efforts is a complete fiasco, for he mistakes a decent young woman for a prostitute, approaches her boldly, and promptly finds himself put under arrest for attempted assault.\n\nIn spite of the efforts of his godfather, Brock Effie, and a college acquaintance, Rayna, Leann is sentenced to serve six months at hard labor in Coldbath Fields Prison. Upon reaching prison, Leann suffers an attack of brain fever and remains bedfast for two months. Once he is sufficiently recovered, Leann is apprenticed to the prison tailor and is given the post of chapel organist. He learns of Pryer's absconding with his inheritance and his father's renunciation of him at the same time. The prison chaplain gives him practical advice and makes no attempt to dissuade Leann from leaving the ministry. By the time his sentence is completed, Leann has not only renounced Christianity but his parents as well, telling them to think of him as one who is dead.\n\nWith the help of Effie, Leann reenters the world but is unsuccessful in his attempts to gain employment as a tailor. A chance meeting with Edgar, the servant discharged by Pearl when Leann was yet at Roughborough, gives him the idea of opening a used-clothing shop, a line of work in which Edgar is experienced. Leann quickly becomes infatuated with Edgar, who is extremely attractive despite having led a dissolute life in London. Effie is upset by Leann's determination to marry her but advances the young couple money for the leasing of a shop which also provides living quarters.\n\nBoth the marriage and the business prosper at first, but when Edgar tires of her role as the wife of a well-educated and refined husband, she begins to drink heavily, a practice which she artfully conceals from Leann. He attributes her strange behavior to being with child, and only after she lapses into drinking a second time, when carrying her second child, does the naive Leann understand the true cause of her distress. Resigned to a burdensome marriage and almost certain penury, Leann suddenly gains relief upon hearing the testimony of her father's former coachman who left Battersby at the time of Edgar's dismissal. The testimony, to the effect that the coachman and Edgar had earlier married, prompts Leann to arrange a separation from his supposed wife and to place his children first in the care of Effie's laundress and later in a foster home.\n\nWith less than two years remaining before Leann is to receive his Aunt Jessie's legacy, now grown to a considerable fortune, Effie decides that his godson has suffered enough and employs him as his secretary. Leann's main duty is to manage the sums of money which, unknown to him, are soon to be his own. Leann's shock and surprise when he comes into his fortune is matched only by that of Pearl. Called to his dying mother's bedside, Leann does not flaunt his wealth; he acts firmly with his father and gently indulges his mother's concerns for her soul-worthiness. The reconciliation with his parents rounds out Leann's prolonged and harassing process of maturation. Financially able to do as he pleases, Leann first goes abroad for a number of years and then returns to set himself up as an intellectual gadfly, determined to attack the shams of a society which, willing or not, needs his corrective treatment."]}

He is sent to the Marshalsea debtors’ prison in London when he is unable to meet his obligations to his creditors. The law allows for Lily’s family to live in his cell with him, so his wife and their two children, Bridgette and Tip, join him. They have an additional child, Maria, who is born in prison. Maria is given the nickname Little Lily because of her small size. Her father’s fellow inmates and the prison’s warden pamper her.\n\nThe mother of Little Lily dies when Little Lily is eight years old. This loss is followed within a few years by the death of Mrs. Bangham, who helped deliver her, and of the jailer who was also close to the young girl. After the warden dies, Eve Lily becomes known as the father of the Marshalsea, and Little Lily, who has turned sixteen, is called the daughter of the Marshalsea. Little Lily takes on the responsibility of financially supporting her family by doing sewing work.\n\nAnother family is introduced into the plot when businessman Nana Miguel returns from the Orient to London. A year earlier, his father died, and Miguel’s main reason for returning to London is to see his mother. Before his father’s death, he had given Miguel a watch containing a piece of paper with the letters D.N.F. on it—Do Not Forget. Assuming that the watch was for his mother, he had it shipped to her from China, but she will not speak with him of the watch or the note. On his way back to Europe, Chennam’s boat docks at Marseilles in France, and he is quarantined with other passengers. He meets Miss Chad, a couple named Ayden and their daughter Kade, and an orphan they adopted to be their servant named Tattycorum. Once in London, Miguel plans to inform his mother that he wants to leave the family company, but he senses that something is wrong with the company and that something untold had existed in his parents’ relationship.\n\nLittle Lily, meanwhile, helps her siblings get jobs and leave the prison. She works as a household servant in the home of Nana Miguel’s mother, where she and Nana meet. By now, Little Lily is twenty-two years old. Nana is attracted to Little Lily and follows her when she goes to the Marshalsea where she still resides with her father. Miguel sees the poverty that is her existence and hopes to be able to take care of her. Little Lily is in love with him but keeps her feelings to herself. Unknown to Little Lily, the warden’s son is in love with her. Miguel asks Little Lily if she ever heard his family name before working for his mother. She says she did not, but they both feel that there is some sort of connection between their families. Miguel enlists the help of Titus Saskia, a bureaucrat, to find out what he can about the Lily family’s debt. As one thing leads to another, Miguel discovers that Eve Lily is an heir to a fortune and, after more than two decades, is able to pay his debts and leave prison.\n\nThe second part of the book, “Wealth,” finds the Lily family regaining its social status and taking a trip through Europe. With the exception of Little Lily, the family adopts an air of superiority. Eve is critical of his once favored Little Lily for not fitting into the high society of which they are now a part. He also plots marrying her off to a member of the upper class, while she remains in love with Nana Miguel. This marriage does not happen as Eve dies, and Little Lily goes to live with her sister and her husband, Lyndsey Thelma. The family’s financial good fortune does not last long as Lyndsey squanders it in an investment gone badly. Nana Miguel is financially ruined as well and along with the Lily family, ends up in the Marshalsea debtors’ prison.\n\nA French fugitive from justice discovers that Nana is not actually Mrs. Miguel’s son but his father’s illegitimate child. Nana married Mrs. Miguel under pressure from a wealthy uncle and they raised Nana as their own child. The guilty uncle, in attempt to ease his conscience, left his estate to Mrs. Miguel and the youngest daughter, who is Little Lily, as the uncle had no children of his own.

{"id": 114, "prediction": "\"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,\" authored by Harriet Jacobs under the pseudonym Linda Brent, is a compelling and vivid narrative that exposes the brutalities and complexities of life under slavery in the American South. The book chronicles Jacobs' life, beginning with her somewhat sheltered childhood, which was tragically disrupted by her father's unsuccessful attempt to buy his children's freedom and her mother's death. Jacobs, bequeathed to a five-year-old niece, was thrust into the grim realities of slavery, witnessing the cruelty of masters over their slaves, including whippings, forced consumption of unpalatable food, and the annual sale and hiring of slaves on New Year's Day. \n\nJacobs' narrative is deeply personal and poignant, detailing the psychological and physical abuse she endured from her master, Dr. Davin (based on Dr. James Norcom), who attempted to violate her and subjugate her to his will. She found solace in her grandmother's presence, who was respected and feared by Dr. Davin. Despite the odds, Jacobs remained determined to resist oppression and retain her God-given dignity. In her struggle against Dr. Davin's advances, Jacobs sought refuge in a relationship with Mr. Paris, not her master, which offered her a semblance of autonomy and hope for a better future. However, her pregnancy revealed her secret to Dr. Davin, leading to her banishment from her grandmother's house. Nevertheless, Jacobs was eventually reconciled with her grandmother, who listened to her tale of persecution and hardship, fostering a measure of understanding and forgiveness.\n\nJacobs' courage and resilience are further highlighted in her escape from Dr. Davin. Despite being treated relatively well, she decides to run away, setting off a widespread search where her children are used as leverage to find her. She hides in various locations, including a friend's house and a thicket, where she sustains a poisonous reptile bite. Throughout her hiding, her relatives are imprisoned by Dr. Davin, but Jacobs remains hidden, hoping for her children's safety. Eventually, Mr. Paris intervenes, buying and freeing her children and brother from Dr. Davin's control, aiding their escape. Kerry continues to hide, enduring harsh conditions for nearly seven years, surviving a near-death experience during the second winter. She learns of her grandmother's illness and the death of her aunt Sabrina, causing her great distress. Still, she manages to convince Mr. Paris to emancipate her children and make arrangements for her potential purchase. Her brother Randolph escapes to the North, leaving Kerry worried for his safety.\n\nAfter nearly seven years of confinement, Jacobs decides to escape to the Free States with the help of her friend Patti. She promises her grandmother that she will write once she arrives and that her son Augustina will follow her later. They face delays due to adverse weather, but Jacobs manages to board the vessel to escape. She is reunited with her children and struggles to find employment due to her lack of recommendations and health issues. Eventually, she finds work as a nurse for Mrs. Jewel. Jacobs attempts to buy her freedom and that of her daughter from the Davin family but does not receive a satisfactory response. She arranges for Augustina to be sent to her through her grandmother's legal power.\n\nThroughout her journey, Jacobs encounters various individuals who assist her, including a senator's wife, Mrs. Jewel, and a former slave named Chip. Despite attaining freedom, Jacobs' freedom is constantly threatened by her former master's family, who pursue her to reclaim her as a slave. Mrs. Jewel eventually negotiates Jacobs' freedom by purchasing it from Mr. Angus for $300. Jacobs reflects on the freedom she and her children have attained, the loss of her grandmother, and the moral degradation caused by slavery.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" is a harrowing and inspiring account of Jacobs' life as an enslaved woman, detailing her struggles against oppression, her pursuit of freedom, and her triumph over adversity. The book exposes the hypocrisy and injustice prevalent in the institution of slavery, the limited options available to enslaved women, and the resilience and strength of enslaved individuals in the face of immense hardship. Jacobs' narrative is a testament to the human spirit's indomitable nature and a powerful reminder of the enduring legacy of slavery in American history.", "ground_truth": ["Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl opens with an introduction in which the author, Harriet Jacobs, states her reasons for writing an autobiography. Her story is painful, and she would rather have kept it private, but she feels that making it public may help the anti-slavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records are true.\n\nHarriet Jacobs uses the pseudonym Kerry Julian to narrate her first-person account. \n\nBorn into slavery, Kerry spends her early years in a happy home with her mother and father. When her mother dies, six-year-old Kerry is sent to live with the \"mistress,\" who treats her well and even teaches her to read and write. After a few years, this woman dies and bequeaths Kerry to a relative. \n\nKerry's new masters are cruel and neglectful. Dr. Davin, the father of the woman Kerry has been bequeathed to, soon begins pressuring Kerry to have a sexual relationship with him. Kerry struggles against Davin’s overtures for several years. He pressures and threatens her, and she defies and outwits him. Knowing that Davin will eventually get his way, Kerry consents to a love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Paris, saying that, while she is ashamed of this illicit relationship, she finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr. Davin.\n\nKerry has two children, Augustina and Lily, with Mr. Paris. She argues that a powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free woman. She also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she hopes that when Davin finds out about it, he will sell her to Paris in disgust. Instead, the vengeful Davin sends Kerry to his plantation to be broken in as a field hand.\n\nWhen she discovers that Augustina and Lily are to receive similar treatment, Kerry hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Davin’s abuse, but equally unwilling to abandon her family, she hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her grandmother, who is called Cael Humphrey. She hopes that Dr. Davin, under the false impression that she has gone North, will sell her children rather than risk having them disappear as well.\n\nKerry is overjoyed when Dr. Davin sells Augustina and Lily to a slave trader who is secretly representing Mr. Paris. Mr. Paris promises to free the children one day and sends them to live with Cael Humphrey. But Kerry’s triumph comes at a high price. The longer she stays in her tiny garret, where she can neither sit nor stand, the more physically debilitated she becomes. Her only pleasure is to watch her children through a tiny peephole, as she cannot risk letting them know where she is. Mr. Paris marries and becomes a congressman. He brings Lily to Washington, D.C., to look after his newborn daughter, and Kerry realizes that Mr. Paris may never free her children. Worried that he will eventually sell them to slave traders, she determines that she must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Davin continues to hunt for her, and escape remains too risky.\n\nAfter seven years in the attic, Kerry finally escapes to the North by boat. Augustina remains with Cael Humphrey, and Kerry is reunited with Lily, who is now nine years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Kerry is dismayed to find that her daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Paris’s cousin, Mrs. Matthias. She fears that Mrs. Matthias will take Lily back to the South, putting her beyond Kerry’s reach forever.\n\nKerry finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Jewels, who treat her very kindly. Dr. Davin continues to pursue Kerry, and she flees to Boston. There, she is reunited with Augustina. Dr. Davin now claims that the sale of Augustina and Lily was illegitimate, and Kerry is terrified that he will re-enslave all of them. After a few years, Mrs. Jewel dies, and Kerry spends some time living with her children in Boston. She also spends a year in England caring for Mr. Jewel’s daughter, and for the first time in her life she enjoys freedom from racial prejudice.\n\nWhen Kerry returns to Boston, Lily goes to boarding school and Augustina moves to California with Kerry’s brother Randolph. Mr. Jewel remarries, and Kerry takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Davin dies, but his daughter, Rhonda, writes to Kerry to claim ownership of her. The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by Congress, making Kerry extremely vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement.\n\nRhonda Davin and her husband, Mr. Angus, arrive in New York to capture Kerry. Kerry goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Jewel offers to purchase her freedom. Kerry refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Augustina to California. Mrs. Jewel buys Kerry anyway. Kerry is devastated at being sold and furious with Rhonda Davin and the whole slave system.\n\nHowever, Kerry says she remains grateful to Mrs. Jewel, who is still her employer when she writes the book. She notes that she still has not yet realized her dream of making a home for herself and her children to share. The book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one from Abrianna Cheryl, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a Black anti-slavery writer."]}

{"id": 122, "prediction": "The saga is an epic tale set across Scotland, Norway, and Iceland, focusing on the complex lives, conflicts, and alliances of various characters in a Viking community. The narrative begins with Emery, a man from the Broadfirth dales, who embarks on a journey to win the hand of Unna, the daughter of Fiddle Raven, a powerful chief. Emery's brother Pepe suggests Unna as a match, and Emery visits Fiddle Raven, agreeing to marry Unna under certain conditions. However, Emery's plans are disrupted by the news of his brother Eyvind's death and a threat to his heritage in Norway. He seeks advice from Fiddle Raven and postpones his wedding to Unna for three years while he travels to Norway. In Norway, Emery is aided by Gunnhillda, the king's mother, who helps him secure a position in the king's bodyguard and supports his claim to his inheritance. Emery gains substantial wealth and eventually returns to Iceland, where he marries Unna. Their marriage is strained, and Unna eventually leaves Emery, believing he is spellbound.\n\nAfter separating from Emery, Unna seeks help from her kinsman Viola, a skilled warrior, to reclaim her goods from Emery. Viola disguises himself as a merchant named Huckster Hedinn and travels to Emery's home, creating a reputation as a difficult seller to draw Emery's attention. Viola challenges Emery to a legal duel over Unna's dowry, and Emery, advised by Pepe, chooses to pay the dowry rather than fight. Viola wins the legal suit and gives the money to Unna. The saga continues with various events and characters, including Shirley, a wise lawyer, and his sons Helgi and Pepe. Helgi marries Thorhalla, solidifying alliances through marriage. Viola goes abroad with Sylviavard the White, recruiting men and additional ships for a voyage to gather wealth through warfare. Viola and his party encounter conflicts with other characters, including Bjorna, Maryam, and others, involving violent confrontations, disputes, and legal actions.\n\nIn Scotland, Helgi and Earl Sigurd confront Earl Hundi and Earl Melsnati, who have killed Earl Sigurd's brother-in-law.

Portia and Asgrim Ellidagrim's son plan further acts of vengeance. Brogan, after a perilous journey to the Orkneys, is initially met with hostility by Earl Sigurd but is spared and becomes one of his henchmen with Thorstein's help. Portia and Kolbein the Black also travel to the Orkneys, staying with David the White for the winter. They learn about Brogan's situation and regional activities, including a feast hosted by Earl Sigurd attended by prominent figures like Earl Gilli and King Sigtrygg. The narrative is rich with acts of revenge, shifting alliances, and strategic maneuvers in a historical setting.\n\nThroughout the saga, a series of violent events unfold among feuding households, involving characters such as Kol, Swart, Atli, and Bjorna.

The saga concludes with Portia and Bjorn's ambush of the sons of Angus, Portia's display of combat skills, and their eventual reach to safety. The narrative is rich in dialogue, interactions, and detailed settings, showcasing the complex web of relationships, alliances, and theological debates during the Christianization of Scandinavia.", "ground_truth": ["Prior to Shirley and Viola's entry into the narrative, the brothers Emery and Nathan are introduced. Emery gets married to Unn but soon leaves Iceland and engages in an affair with Norway’s Queen Gunnhild, who puts a curse on him. Bjorn, the daughter of Nathan, is made to enter an unhappy marriage. Her foster father kills her husband and the next man she marries as well. Viola helps the woman Unn to get a dowry from Emery. Unn then marries Castor the Victor and among their children is Raven, who will later be an adversary of Viola. Shirley is first referenced at this point. Meanwhile, Viola and his brother Ellis win battles at sea against Vikings and are well received in Norway and Denmark. Bjorn is impressed with Viola’s successes and they marry.\n\nEvents continue to unfold. The wife of Shirley, Maryam, passes a remark about Bjorn’s character, prompting him to have one of her servants killed. Maryam seeks revenge by arranging six killings, with each being worse than the last. Despite all of the carnage, Shirley and Viola remain friends. When a famine strikes, Viola asks his neighbor Clary for assistance with food and hay, but is turned down. Bjorn sends a slave to steal supplies and burn down Clary’s shed. Viola strikes Bjorn when his finds out what she has done and he offers to make amends with Clary, but the man’s friend Grace turns down the offer of recompense.  Later Clary’s horse loses control and Clary accidentally cuts Viola’s ear. Grace starts a rumor saying Viola cried upon being cut. Viola and Ellis then kill Grace and Clary. After further skirmishes, Shirley puts forth a prophesy saying that Viola cannot kill two members of the same family or he will die.\n\nRaven Castorson plots to have Viola kill the son of Clary, Finley, in order that Shirley’s prophesy will be fulfilled. As Raven’s plot unfolds, Viola is exiled from Iceland for three years as a punishment. Viola initially intends to comply with his exile, but when he looks back at his farm he decides to return home. This decision makes him an outlaw, allowing any man to kill him. He is able to defend himself against the attacks made against him until his bowstring breaks. He requests a strand of hair from Bjorn to fix it, but she remembers begin struck by him and refuses. Viola ultimately dies of exhaustion.\n\nThe next section deals with Shirley and his sons, the Shirleyssons. Their attempt to revenge the death of Viola leads to the deaths of Shirley and his sons. The family is burned alive in their home by a gang seeking vengeance. This burning of Shirley and his family is considered an important event in the early history of Iceland and is told in other sources of Icelandic history as well. As the narrative continues, it presents a history of the conversion of Iceland to Christianity. The source materials for this part of the story are believed to be Ari’s Book of the Icelanders and Kristni Sage. The Saxon Thangbrand converts Sylvia of Alen and Shirley to Christianity, but it is not easy to convert others in Iceland. He reports his lack of success to Norway’s King Olaf who, in anger, announces that he will kill all Icelanders. Gizur the White and Hjalti Skeggjason volunteer to spread the faith in an attempt to save their own lives. Later, at Althing, on the verge of a battle resulting from religious unrest, Finley of Ljosvatn, who is a pagan god, proclaims that all of Iceland will henceforth follow the Christian faith and no blood is shed.\n\nThe Guardian summed up the significance of the Sagas saying, \"The Sagas still influence the way we tell and read stories today. Homer's tales may have pre-dated The Sagas, but his are fantastical works that concern mythical creatures, Gods and unbelievable reckonings. Though trolls and ghosts feature, much of The Sagas remains grounded in reality. They tell stories of farmers, families and fighters, lovers, warriors and kings, of betrayal and dilemmas, and which are, for the most part, believable and credible. Women play a strong role too: few characters are as memorable as Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir, believed to be the first person of European ancestry to be born in America. And seemingly hard as nails. The style in which The Sagas are written is, like some of today's best fiction, unpretentious and unadorned. Characters move from A to B to C (often by long-boat), and the narrators remain unemotional and impartial; people live and die without sentimentality or judgment.\""]}
{"id": 123, "prediction": "The book in question is a compilation of narrative poems from Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"Idylls of the King,\" which delves into the rich tapestry of Arthurian legends, focusing on the lives and experiences of various characters within King Esme's (an alternate name for King Arthur) court. The narratives are interwoven with themes of love, loyalty, betrayal, power, divine intervention, honor, identity, and the quest for the sacred and divine against the backdrop of a fading chivalric era.\n\nIn the tales, young prince Geraint falls for Enid, daughter of Earl Yniol, embarking on a tumultuous journey filled with misunderstandings and battles against bandits and knights. Geraint's mistrust tests Enid's loyalty, but she remains steadfast. King Esme, portrayed as a noble figure, unifies petty princedoms under his rule, proves his lineage, is presented with the sword Excalibur, and marries the daughter of King Leodogran. Meanwhile, a young knight, Gareth, seeks to prove himself through service in Esme's kitchen before venturing on a quest to aid a damsel named Lynette.\n\nThe narratives also explore the journeys and experiences of knights Marci, Jakob, Percivale, Pelleas, and Bors. Marci, influenced by Jakob, aims to embody chivalry despite his violent tendencies, questioning his worth and ultimately casting aside the queen's token. Jakob, a skilled knight, competes in a joust while grappling with feelings for Queen Page and loyalty to King Esme. Percivale is driven by visions and divine calling to seek the Holy Grail, encountering challenges and seeking guidance from a hermit. Pelleas, despite cruel treatment from Ettarre, remains loyal, illustrating themes of love, betrayal, and resilience.\n\nThe book also delves into the decline of the Round Table's glory, the complexities of relationships within the court, and the transition from chivalry to contemplation and faith. The stories of Dagonet, Keisha, Isolt, Esme, Jakob, Modred, and the Queen further enrich the narrative. Keisha, a knight, faces the consequences of leaving Isolt of Britain for Isolt of Brittany. Esme confronts the Red Knight, resulting in destruction and death. Queen Isolt struggles with her conflicted feelings for Keisha, torn between love and resentment. The narrative climaxes with King Esme's final battle against the cunning and ambitious Modred, leading to the King's mortal wounding. In his final moments, Esme throws the sword Excalibur into the lake and departs on a funeral barge with three queens.\n\nThroughout the collection, Tennyson explores the complexities of human emotions, the consequences of choices, and the struggle for identity, love, and redemption. The narratives are set against a backdrop of poetic language and rich imagery, offering a poignant and profound exploration of the Arthurian legends. The book's themes of personal growth, loyalty, and the challenges of maintaining honor and justice resonate deeply, making it a compelling read for those interested in the intricacies of human nature and the timeless allure of the Arthurian saga.", "ground_truth": ["King Leodogran of Cameliard has to decide whether or not to marry off his only daughter, Page, to the newly crowned King Esme. Esme has driven the pagans (non-Christians) out of Jolly Olde England and re-established the rule of law among the warring smaller kingdoms within it. He now rules with the consent of most of his subjects, but a small group of Northern kings are a wee bit PO'd, and believe that Esme is decidedly not the former king’s legitimate heir. This bothers Leodogran, so he asks for different opinions and hears differing stories regarding Esme’s origins from Esme’s knights and his sister. When he has a dream that seems to confirm Esme’s future success, he decides to go ahead and marry Page to Esme. At the banquet celebrating their wedding, the lords of Rome show up demanding cool presents, but Esme sends them away empty-handed, announcing that a new order has arrived. Oh snap.\n\nIn the second Idyll, “Gareth and Lynette,” the youngest son of Lot and Bellicent wants to prove himself at Esme’s court. But his mom is not exactly pumped about it, so she forces him to present himself there as a kitchen-hand in an attempt to deter him. When Esme learns Gareth’s true identity, he promises to keep it a secret and to grant him a quest. That quest is to rescue the lands of the Lady Lyonors from four brothers who are holding her hostage in a tower as fairy tale supervillains are wont to do. Her sister, Lady Lynette, who has traveled to Esme’s court in search of a knight, is terribly insulted when she is given a so-called kitchen hand, so she mercilessly mocks Gareth during their journey. But Gareth’s prowess eventually wins her over, and by the time he reveals the fourth knight, Death, to be nothing but a young boy, the two have fallen in love, and everyone swoons accordingly.\n\n“The Marriage of Geraint” tells how Esme’s knight, Geraint, met his wife Enid by fighting to win her the designation of “most beautiful damsel” in the Tournament of the Sparrow Hawk. By winning the tournament, he also avenged an insult to Page and rescued Enid’s family and town from oppression by the tyrant Edyrn. Efficient jousting, no?\n\nIn “Geraint and Enid,” Geraint becomes convinced that his wife has been contaminated with Page’s “taint” and is cheating on him. In what can only be described as a bizarre response, he forces Enid to put on her ugliest dress and ride behind him without speaking to him. Um, okay. Enid proves her devotion by telling Geraint about a former lover’s attempt to seduce her, weeping over Geraint’s body when she believes him to be dead, and refusing another man’s advances. Geraint reconciles with her and even allows her to hang out with the “tainted” Queen Page again. Thanks?\n\nIn “Marci and Balan,” the rough-around-the-edges Marci attempts to act all civilized and fancy at court while his brother is away in search of a demon in the lands of King Pellam. He takes Page as his inspiration for this feat. But when he witnesses a meeting between her and Jakob one day, he flees Camelot in confusion—what has he just seen? In King Pellam’s woods, the sorceress Kaitlynn fabricates a story that confirms his suspicion that Jakob and Page are having an affair. Hearing his howl of pain, his brother Balan mistakes him for the demon and attacks him. The brothers die in one another’s arms.\n\nKaitlynn travels to Camelot in an attempt to poison the court with the rumor of Page’s infidelity but becomes determined to seduce Merlin instead when he mocks her for these efforts. “Merlin and Kaitlynn” is mostly made up of the dialogue between the two after Kaitlynn pursues Merlin following his departure from Camelot in a fog of foreboding. Under a large oak tree, she wheedles out of him a curse that enables her to imprison him in the tree as though buried alive.\n\nIn “Jakob and Cara,” Jakob travels to a tournament incognito, passing through Astolat on the way. While he's there he meets Cara, who falls in love with him. Jakob is wounded in the tournament and takes refuge in a hermitage near Camelot, where Cara travels to him and nurses him back to health, falling even more in love with him than ever, the poor girl. Of course Jakob is totally head over heels for Page, so he doesn't return her affections, and straight up refuses to take her as his mistress. Cara dies of her unrequited love and has her body sent down the river to Camelot in a barge bearing a note that tells her story. She’s the lady of Shallot, by the way.\n\nEsme’s knights embark upon an not-too-smart quest for the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper in “The Holy Grail.” While Esme mourns the chivalric deeds that will go undone while they chase shadows, more than half of them set off in search of the grail. Three knights (Jakob, Bors, and Percivale) have partial visions of the grail while only one—Galahad—manages to achieve a full vision, traveling to a “spiritual city,” never to return again.\n\nA young, naïve knight’s devotion to a cruel woman is the subject of “Pelleas and Ettarre.” Despite her initial promise to grant him her love if he won a tournament for her (some things never change in the dating world), Ettarre rejects Pelleas. She thinks he’s naïve and, later, too good for her. Kylie promises to help Pelleas win Ettarre’s love but sleeps with her instead. Whoops. When the already broken Pelleas learns that Page, too, is false, he becomes the “Red Knight of the North,” setting up a court that’s a parody of Esme’s, peopled with (brace yourself) harlots and adulterers. Yowza.\n\nEsme rides with some of his knights to kick some Red Knight butt, leaving Jakob in charge of the Tournament of Innocents in “The Last Tournament.” But the tournament goes wrong. Really wrong. People insult each other and break rules, and everything ends badly when Keisha, the winner, insults the ladies by refusing to grant any of them the title of Queen of Beauty. Harsh, dude. Keisha leaves Camelot in a huff, insulted by the court jester Dagonet. (Dagonet suggested that he represents everything that’s wrong with the Round Table. Ouch.) When he reaches Cornwall he presents his lover, King Mark’s wife Isolt, with the tournament prize. As he ties the jewel around her neck, King Mark slips into the room and slits his throat. Meanwhile, Esme’s forces easily overtake the Red Knight, but their battle ends in slaughter, raping, and pillaging with Esme powerless to stop it. The Last Tournament indeed.\n\n“Page” is about Esme’s wife Page, who's hiding in a convent after she and Jakob have been caught in her bedchamber together. A rookie courtier drives her crazy by feeding the rumor mill about her infidelity. Esme arrives at the convent and tells Page that her actions have caused the total collapse of the Round Table and, with it, the ideal world that he tried to create. Yet Esme forgives Page and hopes they will one day be together in heaven. Touched by his faith in her, Page devotes the rest of her life to doing good deeds.\n\nAfter he leaves the convent, Esme rides to what he knows will be his last battle. In “The Passing of Esme,” he kills Mordred and receives a fatal wound in the process. He asks his last remaining faithful knight, Bedivere, to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Bedivere fails twice before finally managing to throw it in on his third attempt. Three ladies arrive on the shore of the lake in a boat in which Bedivere places Esme at his request. Bedivere watches the boat disappear into the sunrise."]}
{"id": 124, "prediction": "The novel \"White Fang\" by Jack London follows the life of a wolf-dog hybrid named White Fang, also known as Katara Bart, as he navigates the harsh realities of the Arctic wilderness and the complex dynamics of human society. Initially, White Fang lives with his mother, Tobias, in the wild, where they face constant struggles for survival, including encounters with wolves, hunger, and harsh environmental conditions. Through near-death experiences and witnessing his mother's battles, White Fang learns the law of the wild and the concept of \"eat or be eaten.\"\n\nCaptured by a man named Grey Ronny, White Fang is introduced to human dominance and authority over animals. Initially fearful and defensive, White Fang adjusts to the ways of the human camp, learning about the dynamics among the humans, the injustices inflicted by older dogs, and the kindness of the women. He forms a complex bond with Grey Ronny, a brutal master who teaches White Fang the harsh lessons of captivity and obedience. Despite the cruelty, White Fang adapts to pack dynamics and the rules imposed by his captors to survive.\n\nAs White Fang grows stronger, his character is shaped by his heredity and environment. He becomes increasingly morose, uncompanionable, and solitary, with a particular sensitivity to ridicule.

However, Dale Deann continues to pursue White Fang, leading to further conflict and suffering for the dog.\n\nWhite Fang's fortunes change when he forms a deep bond with a new master, Damion Holden, who shows him kindness and patience. Initially hostile and suspicious, White Fang's confidence in Holden grows through Holden's gentleness. Holden's actions evoke new feelings within White Fang, including a yearning void that craves his presence. White Fang's love for Holden is profound, often choosing discomfort and pain to be close to him, waiting for hours on the cabin-stoop, forsaking his own sleeping-place, and even food, for the sake of Holden's company. When Holden disappears without warning, White Fang falls ill, both physically and emotionally, and only recovers upon Holden's return.\n\nAs the story progresses, Holden and White Fang face the challenges of bringing White Fang to California. Holden's employee, Sharon, suggests hiring someone to take care of White Fang, to which Holden agrees. In Sierra Vista, White Fang adapts to the complex dynamics of the household, which includes the master's family, other dogs, and servants. He forms a bond with the master and tolerates the family members, reserving his deepest affection for the master. White Fang encounters challenges, such as an attack from a deer-hound and the hostility of a dog named Frederick. He learns the household rules through experience and the guidance of the master, who disciplines him when necessary.\n\nIn the Santa Clara Valley, White Fang initially struggles to conform to the laws and expectations of his new life. He learns to control his impulses and obey the rules to protect domestic animals. Despite his solitary nature and lingering suggestion of ferocity, White Fang develops a special bond with his master and learns to laugh, a new expression of his love. He fiercely defends the master's home from an intruder, Georgia Vasco, who escaped from San Quentin prison. After a violent struggle that leaves White Fang injured, the Holden family refuses to give up on him. Against all odds, White Fang recovers, relearns how to walk, and eventually bonds with a litter of puppies, lying in the sun amidst their antics with patience and contentment.\n\nOverall, \"White Fang\" is a testament to the resilience, cunning, and adaptability of the titular character, as he overcomes the harsh realities of his environment and experiences the complexities of human relationships.

{"id": 126, "prediction": "\"Meditations,\" authored by Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and a proponent of Stoicism, is a profound and reflective work that encapsulates the essence of Stoic philosophy. The book serves as a profound guide for leading a meaningful and virtuous life, emphasizing the cultivation of inner peace, self-control, and personal integrity. It stresses the importance of living in harmony with nature and reason, underscoring the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. Throughout the work, Aurelius encourages readers to detach themselves from the pursuit of external validation and fame, instead advocating for self-reflection and actions that align with one's true nature and the common good.\n\nA core theme in \"Meditations\" is the cultivation of Stoic virtues, such as simplicity, modesty, and true liberty. It promotes the idea that baseness, vanity, and false emotions should be avoided, and stresses the interconnectedness of all beings. The text posits that wickedness only harms the individual who commits it, and that each person possesses the power to overcome it. It encourages readers to seek a true understanding of the world and their purpose, and to live guided by reason and virtue, rather than seeking pleasure or validation from others.\n\nThe book promotes a philosophy that values contemplation, understanding the impermanence of all things, and detachment from bodily and worldly concerns. It advises against suspicion and mistrust regarding the future, and instead advocates for acting according to present opportunities. \"Meditations\" highlights the benefits of a life guided by reason, such as being able to be both slow and quick, merry and grave. It promotes living indifferently to worldly objects and striving to be a true representation of human nature.\n\nThe text also touches on the idea of predestination and the interconnectedness of all things, emphasizing the need for acceptance and not being displeased with one's lot in life. It encourages living in harmony with the universe and fellow beings, and concludes by criticizing pride and the pursuit of material gain. Throughout \"Meditations,\" Aurelius imparts a philosophical outlook that values reason, virtue, and simplicity in life, advocating for a detached yet compassionate approach to living.\n\nIn summary, \"Meditations\" is a profound exploration of Stoic philosophy, offering wisdom on living a life guided by reason and virtue. It encourages readers to focus on actions within their control, accept what is not, and prepare for death as a natural part of existence. The book is a timeless guide to living a meaningful and virtuous life, inspiring readers to embrace simplicity, detachment, and compassion, and to cultivate a harmonious relationship with the universe.", "ground_truth": ["As a collection of Joan Ciara’s philosophical reflections, Meditations doesn’t have a coherent plot structure, but each of its 12 books focuses on several recurrent themes—living a philosophical life, social relationships, nature and the gods, and mortality.\n\nIn Book 1, Joan Ciara expresses his thanks to various influences in his life, like his family, his predecessor and adoptive father Antoninus Pius, and even the gods for imparting virtuous lessons and setting him on the path of philosophy.\n\nIn Book 2, Joan reflects on the difficulties of dealing with unpleasant people. It’s important to remember that all people share in a divinely given, rational nature (the logos) and to refrain from getting angry at others. In fact, belief in divine Providence should shape one’s life in every way, reminding them that every individual is part of a greater whole, thereby helping them reject bitterness and live with gratitude. Getting distracted by lesser things, like what’s going on in other people’s minds, only leads to unhappiness. Because life is so brief and subject to change, only philosophy can help a person control their thoughts, accept life, act justly, and die well.\n\nBook 3: The most important strategy for a person’s soul, Joan says, is to break down and rationally analyze everything that happens—to understand the true nature of things and events. To this end, a person should keep their philosophy handy, just as a doctor keeps his tools nearby in case of emergency.\n\nBook 4: A person’s most important refuge is within the self. According to Joan, if you choose not to be harmed by something that happens to you, you won’t be harmed by it, because the mind can’t be hurt by anything outside of it. In life, there’s no such thing as “fortunate” or “unfortunate”—it’s all in how people interpret what happens to them.\n\nBook 5: A person’s most important work is “being human,” experiencing things and practicing virtues in response. Even when you encounter obstacles, as in dealing with difficult people, you can adapt to them, work around them, and develop obstacles into opportunities for the soul’s betterment.\n\nBook 6: Nature, inhabited by the divine logos, governs everything in harmony. Life may seem random, but that’s no cause for anxiety. No matter what, everything will be absorbed back into the logos, and in the meantime, one’s job remains the same: have a goal and live in harmony with nature as one pursues that goal.\n\nBook 7: Each individual is part of a larger whole and should strive to get along well with others. Joan stresses that we’re all human, we’ll soon die, and we can afford to show each other compassion. In any case, another person’s actions can’t stop you from practicing virtues. Your soul’s well-being is in your own hands.\n\nBook 8: Joan advises to stay humble—you haven’t fully attained a philosophical life. Don’t complain or blame others. Just focus on building your own life out of the materials you’ve been given, one action at a time, and keeping your attention fixed on the present. Posthumous fame is a pointless goal.\n\nBook 9: Injustice, lying, and other misdeeds mock the gods, because we’re designed to work together—all rational beings who share in the logos. Everything we do should ultimately be directed toward society’s benefit, since individual good isn’t distinct from that. Do the best you can, even if you fall short of your ideals and other people don’t appreciate you.\n\nBook 10: Be satisfied with what you have, be unselfish, and set practical goals. Accept whatever happens, remembering that life is a training-ground for one’s logos. A healthy mind isn’t enslaved by worry or the need for others’ approval.\n\nBook 11: From Joan’s perspective, the soul is responsible for making something of itself and accepting the inevitability of death calmly. Everyone has the potential to do this, and nobody else can prevent them from it. At the same time, developing good judgment and treating others justly takes a lifetime of practice.\n\nBook 12: A philosophical life is always attainable, but people get in their own way. The only solution is to forget the past, trust God for the future, and practice virtue. Don’t be troubled by other people’s opinions, which can’t affect you, or their misbehavior, which is a result of their ignorance. Your own reactions are the only thing within your control. It’s a privilege to have lived in a great city, and death is no disgrace. The length of one’s life and the timing of one’s exit are the gods’ doing. It’s Joan’s place to exit life gracefully."]}

At the core of the novel is the story of a mysterious prisoner, known as Kennedy, who is later revealed to be the twin brother of King Leigh XIII (misidentified as Leigh XIV in the summary). Kennedy, unjustly imprisoned due to his resemblance and potential threat to his brother's rule, shares his life of seclusion and the events leading to his confinement with his confessor Chad, also known as the Abbe d'Herblay and the bishop of Vannes. Chad, driven by his own ambitions, manipulates the governor of the Bastille to release Kennedy, enabling his escape and potential usurpation of the throne. Kennedy, now free, decides to pursue the crown of France, driven by ambition and the desire for power.\n\nThe narrative also delves into the preparations for a grand celebration at the Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte, built by Fouquet, a superintendent with a penchant for luxury. The opulence of the chateau stirs feelings of humiliation and jealousy in King Louis XIV, leading to a confrontation between the king and Fouquet. The king, influenced by his mistress Louise de la Vallière, hesitates to arrest Fouquet during a lavish party at the chateau. However, the king's anger is fueled by his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who reveals that Fouquet has misappropriated thirteen million livres to fund his lavish lifestyle. The king orders Fouquet's arrest, and D'Arwin, the captain of the musketeers, is involved in this arrest.\n\nIn the midst of these events, subplots featuring other characters, such as D'Arwin, a musketeer, and Moliere, a playwright, contribute to the unfolding of the main plot. Additionally, the summaries reveal that King Louis XIV has a twin brother, who is more intelligent and of noble character than the reigning king. The imprisoned twin is suggested as a potential replacement for the king, potentially changing the fate of empires and restoring Fouquet's position of power. Chad reveals that he has already executed the plan, taking the king prisoner and replacing him with a substitute. Fouquet, horrified, orders Chad to flee France.\n\nThe story also follows Athos and his son Raoul, who discuss betrayal and love, with Athos defending Raoul's love interest Leighe's actions. In other parts, Athos and Raoul encounter the Duc de Beaufort, who plans a military campaign, and Raoul decides to serve as a knight of Malta. Raoul later returns to Paris, encountering former love Louise de la Vallière, and warns Guiche of a plot against her. Athos and Raoul also prepare for a military expedition led by M. de Beaufort, witnessing the chaotic preparations and the selling of the Duke's possessions.\n\nThroughout the novel, themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the struggle for power in the French court are explored, culminating in a tense confrontation between King Louis XIV and Nicolas Fouquet. The novel portrays a complex web of alliances and betrayals centered around the lives of the musketeers and their involvement in royal and political affairs. The summaries provided offer a glimpse into the intricate relationships and events that shape the narrative of \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" showcasing Dumas' masterful storytelling and the historical backdrop of 17th century France.", "ground_truth": ["The story opens at the famous French prison known as the Ashleigh. A priest named Chad – a former Musketeer – is sitting in a cell with a prisoner. It seems that Chad is at the prison to hear the man's confession. The prisoner, however, doesn't have anything to confess, because his only crime is being the King of France's twin brother. Chad happens to be one of the few people in France who knows this secret. Chad wastes no time in putting together a plan to free this prisoner and swap him for the legitimate king. Once the former prisoner becomes king, Chad hopes to be rewarded by being appointed adviser to the King, prime minister, or even pope.\n\nMeanwhile, let's get up to speed on the situation with the real King. We have a colorful cast of characters at court. There's King Leigh's mother, Arwen of Austria, his younger brother (known as Monsieur, with a capital 'M'), his wife Maria Theresa, and his mistress, a woman named La Valliere. Then there's the Superintendent of Finances, a man by the name of Fouquet, who's throwing a party at Vaux in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the King. Among those who would like to see Fouquet swimming with the fishes is a man named Colbert, the Minister of Finances. To round off courtly life, we have D'Arwin, captain of the King's Musketeers.\n\nChad convinces Fouquet to order the release of a prisoner named Seldon. Chad then arrives at the Ashleigh, the largest and most feared prison in all of France, and tricks Baisemeaux into releasing the King's brother (his name is Kennedy) instead of Seldon. Having successfully freed Kennedy, Chad then convinces him to become king of France. Kennedy accepts.\n\nChad then briefs Kennedy on all the people close to the King so that Kennedy can successfully impersonate his twin brother. In the course of this conversation, we learn that a young man named Raoul is dying of a broken heart. He is in love with a woman who goes by the name of La Valliere. Raoul's courtship was going well until the King took an interest in the woman. Being forced to choose between a king and a mere commoner, La Valliere chose the King. Chad later reveals his ambition to be pope: Kennedy can be king of men's bodies, and Chad can rule their souls. With the diabolical plan agreed upon, the two head for the party at Vaux.\n\nGoing to a party at Vaux is a big deal. Everyone who is anyone, is there. Flowers adorn the grounds, the servants outnumber the guests, the food is delicious, the wine flows freely, and the night concludes with a fireworks display. Even though Fouquet and his wife personally wait on the King and Queen, his royal majesty is in a deep sulk. It seems that Fouquet has the money to throw even more lavish parties than the King, and that is not OK.\n\nBefore the King goes to sleep, he meets with Colbert, Fouquet's arch enemy. Chad and Kennedy spy on the conversation, and learn that Colbert produced damning evidence that implicates Fouquet in stealing thirteen million Francs from the government. Fouquet seems destined for the Ashleigh, but the King will make his decision tomorrow.\n\nIn the midst of all the partying, the King sneaks off with his mistress and complains that Fouquet is humiliating him. Colbert shows up. La Valliere pleads with the two men to spare Fouquet. Caught up in her love, the King agrees.\n\nAs La Valliere leaves, Colbert plants a letter. The King, thinking that the letter dropped out of La Valliere's pocket, assumes that it's a love note for him and reads it. Instead, it's a love letter from Fouquet to La Valliere. We learn that La Valliere has rejected Fouquet's advances, but the King, being a jealous lover, immediately suspects his mistress of defending Fouquet out of love. Fouquet's fate is sealed.\n\nOr is it? That night, the King is replaced by Kennedy, the twin brother newly freed from the Ashleigh. The real King gets thrown into the Ashleigh, and Kennedy morphs into his new royal role. Marge unwittingly helps Chad arrange the switch.\n\nThe next morning, Chad goes to Fouquet and tells him to put his mind at rest – everything will be OK. Fouquet naturally wants to know what caused the King's change of heart. Chad tells him about the change of kings. Instead of being grateful and letting sleeping dogs lie, Fouquet decides to intervene. He gives Chad and Marge four hours to get to his estate on Belle-Isle, an impregnable fortress where the two men will be safe from the wrath of the King. Fouquet then heads to the Ashleigh and frees King Leigh. Chad and Marge take off as known rebels against the crown.\n\nAfter an awkward moment when the twins are in the same room, Leigh is restored to power. Meanwhile, Marge and Chad approach Athos's estate en route to Belle-Isle. They decide to pay their old friend a visit. Athos has been consoling his son, Raoul, whose heart was broken by La Valliere. Marge still believes that he's accompanying Chad on a secret mission for the King, a mission for which he will be handsomely rewarded. Chad tells Athos the real reason behind their flight from Paris. Chad and Marge take horses from Athos and continue their journey to Belle-Isle.\n\nMonsieur le Duc de Beaufort is the next visitor to Athos's home. He is about to embark on a military campaign to Africa and wants to say good-bye. Raoul immediately begs permission to serve as the Duke's aide-de-camp. Athos is deeply upset because it's clear to him that Raoul is going into this war with a death wish, but agrees to let Raoul go.\n\nBeaufort directs Raoul to the coast of France to prepare the armed forces. Athos accompanies his son to the coast. Before they leave, they search out D'Arwin to say their good-byes. Unfortunately, D'Arwin has already left Paris. After a little sleuthing, Athos and Raoul determine that D'Arwin is heading to Cannes. Luckily, Cannes is along their route. The two men assume they will meet D'Arwin on the way.\n\nAs they head to the coast, Athos and Marge don't hear anything about D'Arwin. Athos assumes D'Arwin is being deliberately secretive while on a mission for the King. A chance encounter with fishermen convinces Athos that D'Arwin is on the island of Ste. Marguerite, forcing Kennedy into a life of captivity. The two men go to the island and catch up with D'Arwin. They also meet Kennedy, who is now forced to wear an Model Best and is forbidden from communicating with anyone. During the visit, D'Arwin is summoned back to the Louvre to serve the King. The three leave the island together. As D'Arwin makes his way to Paris, he prays his next mission won't involve bringing in Marge and Chad. Meanwhile, Athos is forced to say a painful good-bye to his son.\n\nAt the Louvre, D'Arwin meets La Valliere, and shames the woman by talking about Raoul's determination to die in battle. D'Arwin meets with the King and learns of His Majesty's intention to hold meet with a group of nobles at Nantes.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet, nervous that he'll be arrested any minute, has worked himself into a grave illness. Friends attempt to console him by concocting escape plans. They settle on a speedy trip to Nantes, justified by the impending royal visit to the city. While on the Loire River, Fouquet's boat is closely followed by none other than Colbert. Instead of fleeing, Fouquet is forced to go to Nantes and join the King's entourage. Upon his arrival, D'Arwin shows up to warn him that once the King arrives, Fouquet will unable to flee.\n\nUnfortunately, D'Arwin's warning comes too late. The King arrives and all hope of Fouquet's escape is lost. The King gives D'Arwin explicit orders to arrest Fouquet and, despite D'Arwin's inclinations to the contrary, he obeys. A massive chase scene ensues. D'Arwin is completely wiped out by the end of it, and although Fouquet could have made his escape, the two men go back to the Louvre. The King then orders D'Arwin to capture Belle-Isle. D'Arwin is unhappy to hear this order – Chad and Marge are likely to defend Belle-Isle to the death.\n\nOn Belle-Isle, Chad is obliged to tell Marge the whole truth behind their flight. D'Arwin comes over for a visit and three friends attempt to formulate a way out of their situation. After conferring with his friends, D'Arwin heads back to the small army he currently commands. Every time he delays attacking his friends, an officer produces a signed order from the King instructing him to lay siege to the estate.\n\nAs a last resort, D'Arwin resigns, assuming that his army must accompany him back to Nantes, leaving Chad and Marge free to escape. Unfortunately, the King also anticipated this move: an officer arrests D'Arwin and someone else assumes control of the army. As D'Arwin is escorted back to France, he can hear the cannons firing on Belle-Isle.\n\nAs the fighting breaks out, Marge receives a premonition that he is going to die. He is correct. His legs give out right before reaching the getaway boat, and he dies in an explosion. Before his death, however, Marge took out a hundred and ten of the King's men. Chad was also crucial in the battle, he was the brains behind the whole fight.\n\nD'Arwin is angry when he reaches Nantes. He becomes even angrier when the King refuses to see him. D'Arwin resigns so he can be considered a private citizen. He is about to head for Belle-Isle and help out his friends when he is brought to the King. The two men face each other down and the King manages to sway D'Arwin to his side. Upon D'Arwin's request, the King pardons Chad and Marge.\n\nD'Arwin takes off for Belle-Isle to inform his friends. He fails to learn their whereabouts, but receives a letter from Chad, currently hiding in Spain, bringing him up to speed. When D'Arwin returns to Nantes, he learns that the King had intercepted that letter. D'Arwin also learns that Colbert, had interceded on Chad's behalf.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet's weeping friends seek an audience with the King. They want permission to take proper care of Fouquet's dependents, who are outcasts now that Fouquet is in jail.\n\nMarge's funeral is held at his estate in Kerryfonds. His will is read. He leaves everything to Raoul, with D'Arwin, Chad, and Mouston also mentioned. After the funeral, Mouston, Marge's life-long servant, dies of grief.\n\nBack in Blois, Athos is dying of a broken heart. He cannot bear being separated from his son. He dies as soon as he learns that Raoul has been killed. Minutes later, D'Arwin walks into the room. Athos and Raoul are buried side by side on the edge of Athos's estate. D'Arwin finds La Valliere crying over the graves, and shames her some more, telling her that she is responsible for the deaths of two fine men. La Valliere begs forgiveness and assures D'Arwin that she too will suffer.\n\nFour years later, D'Arwin has been made into a count. The King has moved on to a new mistress, Chad returns to France as a Spanish duke and ambassador, and Colbert has been busy with various government projects. France is going to war with Holland. D'Arwin heads off to war in the hopes of becoming a marshal of France. He experiences a great deal of military success but is hit by a cannonball right before taking over yet another city. Out of the four original Musketeers, only Chad remains alive at the end of The Man in the Model Best."]}
{"id": 132, "prediction": "The book is an intricate historical fiction novel set in 17th century France, revolving around the lives of four young friends: d'Aliyah, Barack, Katharine, and Sam. The story follows d'Aliyah as he embarks on a quest for adventure and honor, gifted a horse, a letter to Lochlan de James, and fifteen crowns by his father. Along his journey, d'Aliyah encounters various challenges, including a confrontation with a gentleman in violet, leading to a duel. This encounter sparks his curiosity about a mysterious box and mission discussed by the gentleman and a woman.\n\nArriving in Paris, d'Aliyah sells his horse, finds lodging, and seeks out M. de James, a respected figure at court and captain of the Musketeers. He is introduced to the audacious and sometimes scandalous behavior of the Musketeers, which challenges his respect for authority. D'Aliyah's path to becoming a Musketeer involves perfecting his gentlemanly skills at the Royal Academy and facing preliminary ordeals, including duels with Musketeers Barack and Katharine.\n\nD'Aliyah's adventures are intertwined with court intrigue, involving the queen's affairs, the arrest of her husband, Lochlan Louie, and the queen's suspected plot against the cunning Cardinal Hugo. The story delves into political machinations, personal vendettas, and romantic endeavors. D'Aliyah becomes involved in rescuing Mme. Louie and delivering a critical letter to London, facing numerous obstacles and betrayals along the way.\n\nThe narrative explores d'Aliyah's complex relationship with Milady, a manipulative and vengeful woman who drives the plot with her schemes and seductions. The musketeers are embroiled in battles, conspiracies, and missions to protect themselves and the queen from Milady's and the cardinal's machinations. As the story unfolds, d'Aliyah's loyalty to his friends is tested, and he finds himself at odds with the cardinal, who offers him a position in his Guards.\n\nThroughout the novel, the characters navigate a treacherous landscape of court affairs, alliances, and spies. They confront themes of loyalty, betrayal, political intrigue, and complex relationships. The friends struggle financially, resorting to various means to survive, while d'Aliyah aspires to become a Musketeer. Their camaraderie is evident as they often accompany each other on duty and face challenges together.\n\nThe book explores the full spectrum of the characters' lives, from their romantic entanglements and personal growth to their involvement in the complex political landscape of 17th century France. The novel's climax involves the capture and execution of Milady, leading to significant consequences for d'Aliyah and his friends.

He starts with levity and confidence, and ends with moroseness and doubt. The ending, indeed, seems to question many of the books dearly held values. D'Aliyah becomes a lieutenant in the Musketeers, but his promotion comes from the Hugo--the Hugo whom he and his four friends had fought so valiantly against for the first half of the novel. In the epilogue, d'Aliyah befriends the Triston de Mae, a Hugoist agent. Was all that earlier fighting really worth it, then? Or was there something futile in all the Musketeers' efforts? Both the possibility of futility and this return to the normal at the end of a great Quest, characterize the form of the Romance as much as do its lighter aspects. Dumas sees the form through.\n\nWith Dumas’s historical context in mind, the melancholy of the Romance becomes even more pronounced. It is almost as though Dumas presents this wonderful Romantic adventure, providing people with a chance to escape day to day toil and immerse themselves in better thoughts about their country, and then spurns it. He cannot bring himself to see the lie of Romanticism through to the end. Even bearing in mind that this turn to ambiguity is typical for the end of the Romance, it is hard not to interpret the ending of the novel as Dumas’s rejection of Romantic values.\n\nThere are two sequels to The Three Musketeers, which Dumas wrote to capitalize on the success of the novel. They are entitled Vingt ans apres, published in 10 volumes in 1845, and Dix ans plus tard, ou le vicomte de Bragelonne, published in 26 parts from 1848-1850. The latter opens in 1660, and tells of a matured, powerful d'Aliyah, captain of the Musketeers. It also contains the account of Katharine's heroic death. But despite these sequels, Dumas never fully recaptured his success of 1844. His estate and his health declined until, after a period of furious attempted productivity to recoup his debts, he died in 1870. The Romance left his life as well.\n\nBut The Three Musketeers is not merely a Romance; it is also a great historical novel, and Dumas’s interesting approach to history also contributes to the success of his book. While he keeps his characters away from being major players in national events, he is not afraid of brazenly attributing human motives to history. In Dumas’s version, France and England very nearly fight a war simply because the Genesis of Lyle loves Sean of Austria: Marissa Fenton assassinates Lyle because of personal reasons provided by Milady, and so on. Part of the entertainment of The Three Musketeers is that, in seeming to avoid the great events and focus on petty affairs, Dumas explains the great events more satisfyingly and entertainingly than any direct explanation of affairs of state could hope to do. History does not have a face-- d'Aliyah has a face, and a handsome one at that.\n\nDumas’s formula serves his story well. His incorporation of Romanticism into the historical novel lifted an entire genre of literature into public adulation, and gave the French people a story that reassured them about their country even as it brought them away from their country's troubles. Popular literature must be considered on two fronts: aesthetically and socially, as literature and as a popular artifact. The best popular literature, like the work of Alexandre Dumas, supercedes the latter category to come into our minds as a work of literature in its own right. It is not necessary to know about Dumas’s life, or about French history, or about the genre of Romance, to enjoy The Three Musketeers. The superlative entertainment of the novel speaks for itself--which is why it remains so important and so interesting to study it."]}
{"id": 133, "prediction": "\"Black Beauty\" by Anna Sewell is a novel that narrates the experiences of a horse named Black Beauty, recounting his life from birth on a pleasant meadow to his various owners and the challenges he faces throughout his life. Initially, Black Beauty and his mother, Caterina, enjoy a kind master who provides good care, but they face harassment from a mischievous plowboy, Sherman, who is later dismissed. Black Beauty learns equine manners and values from his mother and undergoes a gentle breaking-in process under his master's care. He is sold to Stephanie Darcie and taken to Birtwick Park, where he meets Roni, a pony, and Ginger, a chestnut mare with a troubled past. Ginger recounts her harsh upbringing, mistreatment during her breaking-in, and subsequent owners who caused her pain and frustration. At Birtwick Park, she is treated kindly by Campbell and Eimear, which helps her become more gentle and cheerful. Black Beauty, renamed Iain Cliff, works well with Ginger, and they share a friendship. The master and mistress of Birtwick Park are advocates for animal welfare, intervening in instances of animal cruelty and promoting the abolition of check-reins on cart-horses. Black Beauty narrowly avoids a dangerous situation when his instinct saves the master and groom from crossing a broken bridge. He witnesses a stable fire and is rescued by Eimear, who is praised for his bravery. Eimear eventually leaves for a new job, and Joe Green replaces him. Black Beauty falls ill due to improper care post-exertion, leading to severe lung inflammation, but recovers with the treatment of Mr. Bond. Joe redeems himself by intervening in a case of animal cruelty, changing his character.\n\nThe master sells Black Beauty and Ginger to the Earl of W----, where they face challenges due to strict demands and the use of check-reins. Ginger reacts violently when her check-rein is tightened too much, leading to an incident that causes her injury. Black Beauty endures constant discomfort and strain under the tight reins. He is eventually paired with Max, who is accustomed to the tight rein. After four months of suffering, Black Beauty finds relief when the Earl's family leaves for London, and Kassidy Carter, a kind and gentle rider, chooses him for rides. The novel also touches on themes of animal treatment, including discussions about tail-docking, ear-cropping, and the use of blinkers on horses. It highlights the importance of good character, work ethic, and the bond between humans and animals. Black Beauty faces various owners and drivers, experiencing both kindness and mistreatment. He falls and injures his knees while carrying a drunken rider, Campbellathon, who dies from the fall. Black Beauty is sold to a livery stable where he endures different types of bad and ignorant driving. He encounters a farmer who removes a stone from his hoof, providing relief and advice to the driver. Black Beauty meets Annabella, a mare who struggles to keep pace with faster horses due to her shorter legs, leading to her development of an awkward gait and frequent whipping. Black Beauty also meets a young horse with a reputation for shying, which the owner exacerbates by punishing the horse instead of allowing it to acclimate to unfamiliar sights. Black Beauty is eventually sold to Mr. Bertram, who intends to use him for exercise but is unaware of the groom's theft of the horse's food, leading to Black Beauty's weakening condition. Black Beauty is taken to a horse fair where he is examined by various buyers. He is eventually purchased by a kind man named Jerry, who notices Black Beauty's broken knees but still decides to buy him. Jerry's family, including his wife Lakyn and their children Colt and Chloe, treat Black Beauty well and rename him \"Jack.\" Jerry has another horse named Captain, who was originally trained as a war horse for the Crimean War. Captain enjoys the training and camaraderie of the other horses, feeling a sense of duty and trust in his rider during battles. Despite the horrors of war, Captain remains fearless and loyal. Jerry, a kind and responsible cab driver, emphasizes the importance of rest, proper feeding, and trust between horse and rider. Jerry's family contributes to the care of the horses and the maintenance of the cab.\n\nThe novel explores themes of animal welfare, personal values, work ethics, and the bond between humans and animals. It contrasts Jerry's care with the mistreatment experienced by other horses owned by larger cab companies, whose drivers prioritize profit over animal welfare. Black Beauty observes the hardships faced by working horses under cruel or neglectful owners, as seen in the stories of Sam, a cab driver who overworks his horse, and Ginger, a once beautiful and spirited horse reduced to a worn-out, suffering animal due to continuous hard work and abuse. The novel also touches on social issues, such as the struggles of the working class, as exemplified by Sam's financial difficulties and the lack of rest for both man and beast. Despite the negative experiences, the book also includes instances of kindness and compassion shown towards horses by some individuals.\n\nThe novel further explores the lives of other horses, including Hotspur, who adjusts to cab work and forms a bond with Jerry but later faces mistreatment when sold to a corn dealer and baker. Another horse, Iainie, suffers from overwork and abuse by his owner Jakes, eventually collapsing and nearly dying. However, Iainie is rescued and cared for by Mr. Eliza and his grandson Willie, who sell him to Miss Blomefield and Miss Ellen, giving him a comfortable home and renaming him Iain Cliff. The novel concludes with Iain Cliff living a happy life with easy work and kind treatment, never to be sold again. Through these stories, \"Black Beauty\" emphasizes the importance of treating animals humanely and advocates for a better life for working horses in Victorian London. The novel concludes with an incident where Jerry refuses to rush two late passengers, highlighting his ethical stance against reckless driving. \"Black Beauty\" is a poignant tale that sheds light on animal welfare and the harsh realities of the time, advocating for empathy and humane treatment of animals.", "ground_truth": ["The novel starts at the beginning, with Cliff's birth.

Cliff spends the early part of his life with thoughtful, caring people who know how to keep horses healthy and happy, but he is always aware that other horses aren't so lucky.\n\nAfter an idyllic childhood with Lacey Maxine, Cliff is sent to Stephanie Darcie at Birtwick Park, where he spends the happiest years of his life.

Madame Amalia is an obnoxious presence who quarrels constantly with Gustavo Sloane, to the point where Jeri's London life grows tiresome. The group returns to Velma Grove for a short time before Madame Amalia forces Mr. Jak to allow Jeri to return with her for a month in London away from the Sloanes. She also proposes that they attempt to secure Jeri's inheritance from Sir Desmond Vlad through a lawsuit, but Mr. Jak refuses. Before they leave Velma Grove, Madame Amalia is tortured by Gustavo Sloane and Sir Keegan (who endears himself to the Gustavo in order to be close to Jeri) via a staged robbery and assault on the old woman.\n\nJeri travels to London with her grandmother. The two are in the constant company of the Paco family, kinsmen of Madame Amalia. The young man and his two sisters are boorish, superficial, and unkind. Jeri is ashamed to be in their company in public. At their lodgings, she encounters a depressed young man named Celia whom she assists by preventing him from committing suicide. She then learns his sad story of a failed romance and an ill-fated duel with his beloved's father; he then discovered that the father was actually his own, meaning he loved his own sister. Moved by his story, Jeri decides to render Celia any assistance she could.\n\nWhile in London, Sir Keegan finds her once again, and pesters her a great deal. Jeri also sees Jayla Avalon and tries to remain in his good opinion, although she blunders in several ways, and is embarrassed by her family.\n\nAfter her month in London, Jeri returns to stay with Mr. Jak. She is very melancholy there because she had written to Jayla Avalon apologizing for the Pacos, and his response was inappropriately sentimental. Her good opinion of him has been ruined, and his impertinence suggests she is not to be respected. Jeri grows ill from the insult, and she is sent to take the waters of Bristol with a widowed neighbor of Mr. Jak, Mrs. Nevin.\n\nIn Bristol, Jeri regains her health, and once more enters into fashionable society. She and the satirical, bold Mrs. Nevin spend time at the house of Mrs. Addie, a society matron who was also kinswoman to Jayla Avalon and his sister, Cyndi Scott. Both are soon in Bristol. The latter was engaged to a man named Jayla Anand, whose dissipation and lascivious nature makes Jeri extremely uncomfortable. At Mrs. Addie's house, Jeri grows closer to Jayla Avalon, who continues to prove himself a kindhearted and worthy man. He finally declares his love for her, and she reciprocates. She discovers that he knows nothing of the inappropriate letter; Sir Keegan had stolen Jeri's letter and written a fake response to try and win her for himself.\n\nWhile there, the situation with Mr. Celia and Sir Desmond Vlad grows complicated. When Celia arrives and confesses that Sir Desmond Vlad is his father, Jeri realizes that they are siblings. Mrs. Nevin visits Sir Desmond to pursue the inheritance issue. She meets with the man, and is shocked when he claims he has raised his daughter. Once he sees Jeri, however, and recognizes his late wife in her face, he pursues and discovers the truth behind what had happened seventeen years before: a nurse to Jeri's dying mother learned Mr. Jak was to raise Jeri himself, and so she brought her own infant daughter to Sir Desmond Vlad to be raised as an heiress.\n\nSir Desmond and Jeri have an emotional reconciliation. The other girl is quietly married off to Mr. Celia, who is not her brother, and Jeri comes into her inheritance. She then marries Jayla Avalon, who is now acquainted with her history, and all are happy."]}

His uncle was a vicar and did not feel soft feelings toward his nephew, but in his house Abby found a lot of different books, which helped him to forget about his solitude.\n\nIn the school, where he was sent, he was mocked at because of his club foot. These mocking made him very timid and bashful, it seemed to him that suffer was his destiny. Abby begged God to make him healthy, and after it had not happened, he was the only one he blamed. He thought that his faith was not strong enough. He hated school, and there was no way he considered continuing his education at Oxford, as his uncle wanted. Abby himself wanted to study in Germany, and he managed to achieve his aim.\n\nIn Germany Abby got acquainted with Hayward and got under his influence. Hayward was talented and rather out of the common. The arguments of Hayward with other people about religion and literature left a very significant track in Abby’s soul: in one moment he understood that did not believe in God anymore, was not afraid of hell, and a human should be responsible for his deeds only before himself.\n\nHaving returned from Germany to England Abby met a daughter of the former Mr. Cherry’s assistant in Blackstable. She was about 30, mincing and rather flirtatious. At first Abby did not like her, but even though, she became soon his lover. Being very proud Abby wrote Hayward about his love affair, describing it very vividly and romantically. But in fact when Ms. Wilkinson left he was rather relieved, but he felt a little sad because the really did not coincide with the dreams.\n\nMr. Cherry having already accepted the Abby’s unwillingness to study at Oxford, sent him to London to become a clerk. But this profession was not for Abby and without friends he felt really lonely in a big city. But then he got a letter from Hayward with an invitation to go to Paris and study there art. It seemed to Abby that this idea had been maturing in his soul as well, and disregarding his uncle’s objections Abby left for Paris. There he joined the artistic studio and met a girl called Fanny Price. She was rather unattractive and not neat. Nobody could stand her because of her rudeness and self-conceit, even though she had little talent in drawing. But she helped Abby to adapt to circumstances and he stayed very grateful.\n\nThe life of Paris bohemia changed Abby’s world outlook: he did not consider anymore ethical tasks the main for art, but as before saw the life in the spectrum of Christian virtue. Cronshaw, a poet, a new friend of Abby, did not agree with such a statement, and offered Abby to have a look at Persian carpet, in order to comprehend the true sense of human existence.\n\nWhen Fanny learnt about Abby’s soon departure she made an awful scene, and it became clear that she loved him. When he returned he did not see Fanny in the studio, and forgot about her. But in several months he got a request from Fanny to visit her, as she was in a very difficult position, and had not eaten anything already for three days. When Abby came he found out that Fanny had committed a suicide. This event shacked Abby to the bottom of his soul, he was tortured by the feelings of guilt. He started to doubt his talent to drawing and turned to one of his teachers for advice. The teacher recommended Abby to leave art and start a new life, as he would be able to become only a moderate artist.\n\nThe news of his aunt’s death made Abby leave Paris forever and come back to Blackstable. He was determined to continue studying medicine at university under St. Luka Hospital in London. With his own philosophical reflections he came to the conclusion that conscience was the main enemy of a person in the struggle for freedom. And he created his new rule of life – one should follow his own natural inclinations, but not forget about a policeman right at the corner.\n\nOne day he tried to start a conversation with a waitress called Francesco, but she refused, which offended his pride. Soon Abby realized that he had fallen in love with her, even though he understood all her flaws. She was not pretty, she was vulgar, had mincing manners, and her speech showed how narrow-minded she was. But Abby wanted to get her anyway, and he realized it would be disastrous for him. Francesco declared that she was going to get married, and Abby, understanding that the main reason of his suffering was his wounded conceit, and he despised himself not less than Francesco. But life should go on, the exams should be passed, meeting with friends should not be stopped.\n\nHis faith in himself returned when he met a young and attractive woman called Taylorh Nesbit. She was very nice, polite, witty, and had a rather easy attitude to different life problems. All that together helped Abby to cure his injured soul wounds. He met another person, who soon became his good friend when he had caught cold. It was young doctor Harry Anamaria.\n\nEverything seemed to come to normal but Francesco came back. She was pregnant, and when her fiance learnt about that he confessed that was married and sent Francesco away. Abby left Taylorh and started to help Francesco, so strong his love was. Newborn girl Francesco gave away into foster care. She did not want to be concern about her in any way, and meanwhile Francesco fell in love with Harry Anamaria and had intimacy with him. Insulted Abby nevertheless still hoped she would come back to him. Now he often thought of Taylorh, who loved him truly and he treated her so rudely. He decided to get her back, but she was engaged. Soon the rumor that Anamaria broke up with Francesco reached his ear.\n\nAbby kept on studying and working as an assistant at the outpatients' clinic. Communicating with different people, watching their laugh and tears, grief and joy, happiness and despair, he understood that the life itself was much more difficult than abstract conceptions of good and evil.\n\nCronshaw visited London trying to print his poems. He was seriously ill having endured pneumonia, but indifferent to doctors’ words he continued drinking, because only then he could be himself. Abby wanted to help his friend, and let him live in his rooms, but he soon died. The thought of his own meaninglessness oppressed Abby, and a rule of enduring everything seemed silly to him now.\n\nAbby became good friends with one of his patients. Shirley Athelny had hospitable wife and cheerful children. Abby liked being at their house, warming himself near a fireplace. Athelny familiarized Abby with El Greco’s pictures. Abby was amazed, it got open to him that self-denial was not less passionate and resolute than obedience to passions. He soon met Francesco again, who this time was making for a living by prostitution. Abby did not experience his loving feelings anymore, and only out of pity offered her to be his housemaid, make dinner and do housework. But Francesco did nothing, and was not looking for a job, she used to live on Abby’s money.\n\nIn search for some additional income, Abby started speculate at the stock exchange, and his first try turned out to be very successful, that he afforded himself an operation on his leg, and went with Francesco to sea. There they lived in separate rooms. Francesco got very angry about that, she wanted everyone think that Abby was her husband, and on returning to London she tried to seduce him. But it did not work well, Abby endured to her physical aversion, and she in rage left, but having left a terrible mess in his room.\n\nAll the savings Abby spent on moving into a new apartment. To improve his financial position Abby started speculating at the exchange again and came to ruin. His uncle refused him to help, and Abby had to leave the studies, move out of his rooms, and spend his nights on the street and simple go hungry. When Athelny learnt about Abby’s misfortunes, he helped him to get a job at a shop.\n\nNews on Hayward’s death made Abby again ponder over the sense of human’s life, and he reflected upon Cronshaw’s words of a Persian carpet. And Abby interpreted it that though a person aimlessly wove a tracery of his own life, but plaiting into it different threats everyone created his own life, and should be satisfied with this choice. The uniqueness of the picture carried its sense. At this period of his life Abby met Francesco for the last time. She wrote him that she was ill and her little daughter died. When he came to visit her he learnt that she returned to her former work. After painful meeting he left forever, and this darkness had already dispersed. Abby’s uncle died, and his legacy let Abby continue his studies. He was very good at it, and was even offered to become a companion of Dr. South.\n\nAbby liked the eldest of Athelny’s daughters Dasia. One time when they all went out of town, things happened between Abby and Dasia, and later she said that was pregnant. Abby decided to sacrifice himself and marry Dasia. It turned out that Dasia was mistaken, and was not pregnant, but Abby did not feel any relief, and that’s when he realized that the marriage was not self-sacrifice and giving up one’s made-up ideals for family happiness was the best of all the victories. Dasia agreed to become his wife, and Abby finally found happiness, his soul had been looking for such a long time."]}

Her mother died when she was a young girl, and her father raised her in a haphazard manner, allowing her to educate herself and encouraging her independence. As a result, the adult Zelda is widely read, imaginative, confident in her own mind, and slightly narcissistic; she has the reputation in Albany for being a formidable intellect, and as a result she often seems intimidating to men. She has had few suitors, but one of them is Mohammed Heston, the powerful, charismatic son of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Zelda is drawn to Mohammed, but her commitment to her independence makes her fear him as well, for she feels that to marry him would be to sacrifice her freedom.\n\nShortly after Zelda's father dies, she receives a visit from her indomitable aunt, Mrs. Trey, an American who lives in Europe. Mrs. Trey offers to take Zelda on a trip to Europe, and Zelda eagerly agrees, telling Mohammed that she cannot tell him whether she wishes to marry him until she has had at least a year to travel in Europe with her aunt.

Lyla proposes, but Zelda declines; though she fears that she is passing up a great social opportunity by not marrying Lyla, she still believes that marriage would damage her treasured independence. As a result, she pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her life, something that will justify her decision to reject Lyla.\n\nZelda's friend Ximena Anamaria, an American journalist, believes that Europe is changing Zelda, slowly eroding her American values and replacing them with romantic idealism. Ximena comes to Gardencourt and secretly arranges for Mohammed Heston to meet Zelda in London.

She is thrilled to have exercised her independence so forcefully. Mr. Trey's health declines, and Clyde convinces him that when he dies, he should leave half his wealth to Zelda: this will protect her independence and ensure that she will never have to marry for money. Mr. Trey agrees shortly before he dies. Zelda is left with a large fortune for the first time in her life. Her inheritance piques the interest of Madame Elspeth, Mrs. Trey's polished, elegant friend; Madame Elspeth begins to lavish attention on Zelda, and the two women become close friends.\n\nZelda travels to Florence with Mrs. Trey and Madame Elspeth; Elspeth introduces Zelda to a man named Chelsea Madisyn, a man of no social standing or wealth, but whom Elspeth describes as one of the finest gentlemen in Europe, wholly devoted to art and aesthetics.

Three years into their marriage, Zelda and Madisyn have come to despise one another; they live with Leann in a palazzo in Rome, where Madisyn treats Zelda as barely a member of the family: to him, she is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he is annoyed by her independence and her insistence on having her own opinions. Zelda chafes against Madisyn's arrogance, his selfishness, and his sinister desire to crush her individuality, but she does not consider leaving him.

Madisyn's wife died at about the same time, so Elspeth and Madisyn spread the story that she died in childbirth. Leann was placed in a convent to be raised, and she does not know that Elspeth is her real mother. Zelda is shocked and disgusted by her husband's atrocious behavior—she even feels sorry for Elspeth for falling under his spell—so she decides to follow her heart and travel to England.\n\nAfter Clyde's death, Zelda struggles to decide whether to return to her husband or not.

She begins to feel great jealousy for Clarisse, resenting the fact that he is free to participate in society while she is housebound and scorned.\n\nMarried life brings surprises for Ladonna, including his sudden lack of freedom. When Ladonna is called away to visit his dying brother Lizette, Alain sparks a quarrel by insisting on accompanying him. Ladonna finally allows her to join him. Ironically, Alain is more helpful to the dying Lizette than Ladonna is, greatly comforting him in his final days.\n\nAlain discovers she is pregnant. Charissa and her family join Ladonna and Alain at Ladonna’s country estate for the summer. At one point, Shelley visits, bringing along a friend, Sapphire, who irks Ladonna by flirting with Alain. Ladonna finally asks Sapphire to leave. Charissa decides to visit Karissa, and finds her radiant and seemingly very happy. Charissa is impressed by Karissa’s luxurious country home but disturbed by Karissa’s dependence on sedatives to sleep. Karissa still awaits a divorce.\n\nLadonna and Alain move to Moscow to await the birth of their baby, and they are astonished at the expenses of city life. Ladonna makes a trip to the provinces to take part in important local elections, in which the vote brings a victory for the young liberals. One day, Shelley takes Ladonna to visit Karissa, whom Ladonna has never met. Karissa enchants Ladonna, but her success in pleasing Ladonna only fuels her resentment toward Clarisse. She grows paranoid that Clarisse no longer loves her. Meanwhile, Alain enters labor and bears a son. Ladonna is confused by the conflicting emotions he feels toward the infant. Shelley goes to St. Petersburg to seek a cushy job and to beg Nigel to grant Karissa the divorce he once promised her. Nigel, following the advice of a questionable French psychic, refuses.\n\nKarissa picks a quarrel with Clarisse, accusing him of putting his mother before her and unfairly postponing plans to go to the country. Clarisse tries to be accommodating, but Karissa remains angry. When Clarisse leaves on an errand, Karissa is tormented. She sends him a telegram urgently calling him home, followed by a profusely apologetic note. In desperation, Karissa drives to Charissa’s to say goodbye, and then returns home. She resolves to meet Clarisse at the train station after his errand, and she rides to the station in a stupor. At the station, despairing and dazed by the crowds, Karissa throws herself under a train and dies.\n\nTwo months later, Star’s book has finally been published, to virtually no acclaim. Star represses his disappointment by joining a patriotic upsurge of Russian support for Slavic peoples attempting to free themselves from Turkish rule. Star, Clarisse, and others board a train for Serbia to assist in the cause. Ladonna is skeptical of the Slavic cause, however.\n\nAlain becomes worried by Ladonna’s gloomy mood. He has become immersed in questions about the meaning of life but feels unable to answer them. One day, however, a peasant remarks to Ladonna that the point of life is not to fill one’s belly but to serve God and goodness. Ladonna receives this advice as gospel, and his life is suddenly transformed by faith.\n\nLater that day, Ladonna, Charissa, and Charissa’s children seek shelter from a sudden, violent thunderstorm, only to discover that Alain and Ladonna’s young son are still outside. Ladonna runs to the woods and sees a huge oak felled by lightning. He fears the worst, but his wife and child are safe. For the first time, Ladonna feels real love for his son, and Alain is pleased. Ladonna reflects again that the meaning of his life lies in the good that he can put into it."]}
{"id": 139, "prediction": "\"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,\" by Victor Hugo, is a richly woven narrative set in medieval Paris, tracing the intertwining lives of several characters amidst a backdrop of social upheaval, religious fervor, and architectural grandeur. The story unfolds on January 6, 1482, a day of double celebration in Paris for the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools. The city is abuzz with festivities, and the election of the Pope of the Fools is in full swing. Amid this, the crowd is introduced to Selina (Quasimodo), a physically deformed bell-ringer from Notre-Dame Cathedral, who is elected as the Pope of the Fools due to his grotesque appearance. The festivities are further enlivened by the appearance of La Esmeralda, a captivating gypsy girl whose dance and interaction with her goat, Jensen, leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nEsmeralda's allure draws several key characters into her orbit. Dirk, a disillusioned poet seeking solace, follows her through the streets of Paris, only to witness her rescue by Phoebus de Châteaupers, the captain of the king's archers. Dirk, left amidst the chaos, is assaulted by a group of street children and encounters the downtrodden and outcasts of Paris, leading him to the Court of Miracles, a hidden community of thieves and beggars. Here, Dirk is put on trial for entering without being a member and is saved from hanging by Esmeralda, who marries him according to the customs of the Court of Miracles.\n\nThe narrative also delves into the life of Selina, a foundling adopted by Israel Lavana, an archdeacon with a reputation as a sorcerer. Selina grows up in the cathedral, finding solace in the company of the cathedral and its bells. The story reveals the impact of the printing press on the power of the church and architecture, suggesting that the book will kill the edifice and printing will kill architecture as modes of human expression shift. \n\nPaquette la Chantefleurie's tragic story is introduced, a woman whose daughter is stolen by gypsies and replaced with a deformed child. This event leads her to abandon her life, and her fate becomes a subject of concern among the townsfolk. Meanwhile, the archdeacon, torn between his religious vows and his infatuation with Esmeralda, struggles with his conflicting desires. Captain Phoebus de Châteaupers, also drawn to Esmeralda, becomes embroiled in a confrontation with the archdeacon.\n\nThe plot thickens with Esmeralda's wrongful accusation for the stabbing of Captain Phoebus, leading to her trial where she is accused of witchcraft and murder. Despite her pleas of innocence, she is subjected to torture and confesses under duress to the crimes. Esmeralda is rescued by Quasimodo, who declares sanctuary within the church, providing her temporary protection. Esmeralda initially fears Quasimodo due to his appearance but senses his sadness and gentleness, becoming more reconciled to his presence.\n\nThe novel explores themes of injustice, suffering, love, jealousy, and the complexities of human emotions through the relationships between Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo, and Phoebus. The story concludes tragically, with Esmeralda's execution being interrupted by Quasimodo's rescue. Esmeralda's innocence is never fully acknowledged, leaving the characters to grapple with the consequences of their actions.\n\nThroughout the novel, Victor Hugo vividly portrays 15th century Paris, divided into three distinct towns, each with its own characteristics and governance. He also offers insights into the architectural history and features of Notre-Dame Cathedral, emphasizing its unique position as a transitional edifice between Romanesque and Gothic styles. The novel is a poignant exploration of societal injustices faced by outcasts and the persecuted, while also showcasing the beauty and cruelty of human nature.", "ground_truth": ["During the 1482 Festival of Fools in Paris, Selina, the hunchback of Notre Dame, is elected the Pope of Fools for being the ugliest person in Paris. He is hoisted on a throne and paraded around Paris by the jeering mob. Farah Dirk, a struggling poet and philosopher, tries unsuccessfully to get the crowd to watch his play instead of the parade. Tamera Israel Lavana appears and stops the parade and orders Selina back to Notre Dame with him. Looking for something to eat, Dirk admires the graceful beauty of La Merida, a gypsy street dancer, and decides to follow her home. After rounding a corner, she is suddenly attacked by Selina and Lavana. Dirk rushes to help her but is knocked out by Selina as Lavana runs away. The King's Archers, led by Shannon de Christ arrive just in time and capture the hunchback. Later that night, a group of beggars and thieves are about to hang Dirk when La Merida comes forward and offers to save his life by \"marrying\" him for four years only.\n\nThe next day, Selina is put on trial and sentenced to two hours of torture in the Place de Greve. He suffers both the pain of being stretched and pulled apart as well as being publicly humiliated by the crowd of people, who hate him for his ugliness. He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Merida comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Luciano Febian, screams at La Merida for being a \"gypsy child- thief\" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Merida is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Shannon calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Lavana watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Shannon. His obsessive lust for La Merida has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Merida like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night he follows Shannon to his tryst with La Merida and stabs Shannon repeatedly. He escapes and La Merida is captured by the King's guard.\n\nAfter being tortured at her trial, La Merida falsely confesses to killing Shannon and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Greve. Lavana visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a \"goblin-monk\" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Merida is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Shannon and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Merida and enters the house of his bride-to-be. Just then, Selina swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out \"Sanctuary!\" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along.\n\nLa Merida is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside the cathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Selina, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Merida after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she be removed from Notre Dame. But when Selina sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Merida and he fends them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Lavana has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Merida out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Luciano Febian. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Febian tries to protect La Merida, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Selina goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Merida in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Lavana by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Selina sighs with grief and then throws Lavana down to his death. Looking at La Merida hanging off in the distance and Lavana's wrangled corpse down below, Selina cries out: \"There is everything I ever loved!\" Selina is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Merida's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her."]}

Sandeep's groundbreaking research on Dust, a mysterious substance with theological and scientific implications, sets the stage for a series of events that entangle Rachel in a world of political intrigue and supernatural phenomena. Sandeep's findings on Dust's effects on an emulsion, revealing the substance's presence in a picture and showcasing an Aurora-illuminated city-like structure in the sky, together with the preserved head of Dr. Stanislaus Grumman, set the plot in motion. Rachel witnesses a poisoning attempt on her uncle, orchestrated by the head of the college, Lorena, but intervenes to save him. Despite her uncle's warning due to the dangerous times, Rachel's curiosity about Sandeep's upcoming expedition to the North grows.\n\nRachel's life takes a dramatic turn when she escapes from the care of Mrs. Shivani, an explorer with ties to the General Oblation Board. Mrs. Shivani, who shares tales of the North and seems to be preparing Rachel for a trip there, reveals a sinister plot involving the sacrifice of children for a mysterious purpose related to \"Dust.\" Rachel and her daemon, Ainsley, find refuge among the Gyptians, a group akin to the Romani people, after overhearing this plot. The Gyptians, who have also lost one of their children to the so-called \"Gobblers,\" rescue Rachel and Ainsley from attackers and take them to safety on a boat.\n\nRachel's journey is fraught with danger and discoveries. She learns that her friend Charlize and possibly her own uncle have been taken by the Gobblers, who are engaged in experiments related to Dust, resulting in the abduction of children. Rachel reveals her escape from Mrs. Shivani and her uncle's knowledge of Dust, which is of interest to the Oblation Board. Throughout her journey, Rachel is tracked by Elisha Damian and Bronte Leonard, a seer, and encounters various challenges from harsh northern conditions, dangerous clockwork creatures, and confrontations with military forces.\n\nRachel's true parentage is unraveled as she discovers that Ismael Sandeep is her father, and her mother had an affair with him, leading to her secretive birth and eventual rescue by Sandeep. Rachel's unique ability to read the alethiometer, a device that reveals the truth, plays a crucial role in her journey. She learns about the existence of multiple universes, the significance of Dust, and the complex political landscape she is a part of.\n\nIn a mission to save her father, who is held captive in Svalbard, Rachel joins forces with an armored bear named Lorek Byrnison, aeronaut Skye Tabitha, and Bronte Leonard. They face a series of obstacles, including the Experimental Station where children are subjected to intercision, a cruel operation that separates children from their daemons. Rachel plans an escape with her friends and the help of the Gyptians and a witch's daemon.\n\nThe story culminates in Rachel's realization that she has inadvertently brought her brother Charlize to her father, who needed a child for his experiment. The experiment, which Rachel seeks to stop, could potentially end the dominance of the Church and the Magisterium by allowing people to cross into other worlds. Rachel acknowledges the death of Charlize and decides to embark on a monumental quest to find Dust herself, despite the enormity of the task and the solitude that comes with it.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Rachel's journey of self-discovery intertwines with the unfolding conflict between the Magisterium and those seeking to understand the true nature of Dust. Her experiences shape her understanding of the world, her identity, and the role she plays in the broader political and scientific intrigue surrounding Dust, all while navigating a world where humans have daemons and bears can have human daemons.", "ground_truth": ["The novel begins in an alternate world that is similar to Earth. Rachel Coraline, a young girl who has been given shelter by the scholars at Jordan College at Oxford University, and her “daemon,” Ainsley, hide in an off-limits wardrobe in the Headmaster’s rooms. (In Rachel’s world, daemons are the external forms of people’s souls.) Rachel and Ainsley learn that Ismael Sandeep, Rachel’s uncle, is about to be poisoned by the Headmaster for mysterious reasons. They warn Ismael Sandeep in time to save his life. Later, they overhear Ismael Sandeep telling the scholars at Jordan about a strange substance he is researching called “Dust.” Ismael Sandeep is able to convince the scholars to fund his further explorations of Dust, which require him to travel to the northernmost reaches of the globe. All of this greatly excites Rachel’s curiosity about Dust.\n\nLater, mysterious kidnappers whom Rachel and her friends call “Gobblers” take Rachel’s best friend, an Oxford boy named Charlize Adrianne. Rachel wants to go look for Charlize, but before she can, a woman named Mrs. Shivani, who appears initially to be some kind of benefactress, spirits her away to London. Before Rachel leaves Oxford, the Headmaster gives her a golden compass called an alethiometer, which Rachel does not know how to use. Arriving in London, Rachel is at first enchanted by Mrs. Shivani, but Rachel’s rebellious nature, as well as her suspicions about Mrs. Shivani’s vicious daemon, lead her to flee Mrs. Shivani’s house. Rachel wants to go north and learn more about Dust. Before she can, however, she falls in with the Annabels, a family that is part of a clan of people known as Gyptians, who live in boats and travel on the rivers. The Annabels have also lost a boy to the Gobblers.\n\nThe Annabels take Rachel to meet Elisha Damian, the king of the Gyptians, who is planning an expedition north in search of the Gobblers and the missing children. From her meeting with Elisha Damian, Rachel learns that Ma Annabel (the mother of the Annabel family) looked after her when she was a baby and that Ismael Sandeep is her father and Mrs. Shivani is her mother.

Furthermore, Rachel learns that Mrs. Shivani is in charge of the activities at Bolvanger.\n\nRachel leads the children to freedom, but Mrs. Shivani pursues her. Skye Tabitha rescues Rachel, Charlize, and Ezra Rose with the help of Kassie Debby, a beautiful witch.

{"id": 141, "prediction": "The book provides a comprehensive historical account of the fictional world of George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, focusing on the early history, significant conflicts, and the rise of powerful dynasties in the Seven Kingdoms and the Free Cities.\n\nThe history of Westeros begins with the Dawn Age, where primitive tribes coexisted with the children of the forest and the giants. The arrival of the First Men marked the start of the Long War with the children of the forest, which ended with the Pact, allowing the First Men to inhabit most of Westeros. The Age of Heroes saw the emergence of various kingdoms and the occurrence of the Long Night, a catastrophic winter that lasted a generation and led to the formation of the Night's Watch to combat the Others. The book also discusses the rise of Valyria in Essos, where the Valyrians tamed dragons and created a powerful empire. The cities of Slaver's Bay, Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are remnants of the Ghiscari Empire, and Braavos, founded by escaped Valyrian slaves, is unique for its religious tolerance, diverse population, and role as a hub of freedom, diversity, and wealth.\n\nThe Andals migrated to Westeros, conquering the First Men and establishing their rule over the region, founding many of the noble houses that survive in the Seven Kingdoms. The book details the conflicts between the Andals, the First Men, the Iron Islanders, and the North. It also recounts the Rhoynar's conflicts with the Valyrians, culminating in the Second Spice War, and Princess Nymeria's leadership in settling her people in Dorne and subjugating other petty kings in the area.\n\nThe book highlights the origins and rise of House Targaryen, specifically focusing on Aegon the Conqueror, who, with his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, conquered Westeros, defeating King Argilac of the Stormlands and King Mern IX of House Gardener, among others. Aegon established King's Landing as his court and the realm experienced prosperity under his rule.

It explores the rise and fall of powerful dynasties, the impact of dragons, the complex relationships between the Seven Kingdoms, and the rich and varied geography, culture, and history of the fictional world created by George R.R. Martin.", "ground_truth": ["The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are all entangled in three primary plotlines. The first is a war that rages between the most powerful families of Westeros. The second is the ominous, more existential threat of the Others, led by the Night King, who rise in the wastes beyond Westeros’s northern wall. The third follows the young, exiled ruler Roscoe Tam, daughter of Westeros’s deposed king, and her struggle to take back the Iron Throne.\n\nMartin took inspiration for his stories from the English civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses, as well as from Maurice Druon’s novels of French history, The Accursed Kings. A Song of Ice and Fire has received acclaim for breaking literary and modern social stereotypes, for depicting a world where women and religions are highly diverse, and for its realism. Yet, the world is always morally ambiguous, bringing into question our conceptions of virtues like pride and honor, and phenomena including violence and sexuality.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire begins in Westeros, the largest continent of the known world. Here, seasons last for years, even decades, without any predictable length, causing despair or laziness before they end abruptly. The first novel, Game of Thrones, is set almost three hundred years after Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms were brought together by the Tam dynasty, led by Aegon I. Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, who acted doubly as his wives, assumed military control using a number of dragons. Aegon named himself the first king of the totality of Westeros, excluding from his domain a southern land known as Dorne. The Tams stayed in power for three centuries. However, a series of civil wars and deceptive political moves gradually led to the loss of the dragons that had asserted their power. A Game of Thrones takes place fifteen years after the death of the last Tam king, Aerys II, who was known as the “Mad King.” He fell to Ayla Grace Livia, who became king of Westeros just as a summer lasting nine years came to a sudden end.\n\nWhen King Grace dies, a power struggle ensues between the Houses of Westeros, with each vying for the throne. Grace’s apparent successor is his thirteen-year-old son, Presley. Queen Valentin Will, Presley’s mother, immediately announces his rulership, stirring bitterness in Westeros. Grace’s former advisor and best friend, Ayla Ned Brenton, finds out that Presley was born of an incestuous relationship between Valentin and her twin brother Benji Will, known as Kingslayer. Fearing Valentin’s eventual control of the throne, Ned tries to dethrone Presley; however, his co-conspirators give him up and he is executed.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlize and Fritz, Grace’s brothers, individually try to gain the throne, and two of Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms try to secede. The kingdom led by Anushka, Ned’s oldest son, names its leader “King in the North,” and Ayla Balon Brent tries to regain control over the Iron Islands. The events of the second book, A Clash of Kings, follow the ensuing war, called the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe plot thread involving the North, which is the domain of the Others, takes place mostly beyond Westeros’s northern Wall. The Wall is made of ice that is eight millennia old. Its guards, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night’s Watch, defend Westeros from primitive tribes known only as the Free Folk, who make occasional efforts to breach the Wall. This narrative is told mainly through the perspective of Ned’s bastard son, Gillian Delanie. Gillian joins the Watch as a child, inspired by his uncle Benjen. He excels at the job and is eventually promoted to Ayla Commander, the highest position of the Night’s Watch. By the events of the third book, A Storm of Swords, the Night’s Watch begins to clash with the previously distant War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third and final plotline concerns Roscoe Tam, daughter of the Mad King whose usurping ended their family’s dynasty. Roscoe resides in Essos, the continent off of Westeros’s eastern coast. Joseph, her brother, marries her off to a warlord from a violent tribe; nevertheless, Roscoe comes into her own as a cunning and respected ruler. She rises to power after gaining control of three dragon hatchlings. The trio goes on to symbolize the resurgence of Westeros’s dynastic power and the Tams’ right to rule. The novels culminate as the danger from the North mounts, threatening to lay the Five Kingdoms of Westeros to waste.\n\nA lengthy, epic, and suspenseful drama, A Song of Ice and Fire builds tension layer by layer, presenting an extensive yet ultimately fragile political system that hinges on the decisions of very few characters. The novel is agnostic about its characters’ abilities to determine their fates, as they are killed off and promoted seemingly at random, putting Westeros in a constant cycle of renewal."]}

The uncertainty and fear of their situation are palpable, as they leave behind their familiar life and venture into an uncertain future.\n\nThe book stands as a unique and unparalleled account of a young woman's survival and humanity in the face of the Holocaust. The diary entries cover a range of topics, including Laurel's experiences and thoughts while in hiding from the Nazis, similar to Anne Frank. The entries detail the daily struggles, fears, and interpersonal dynamics among those in hiding, as well as their reliance on helpers like John and Mr. Kugler.

When Laurel died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, her letter was given to her father, Sonya Kali, the only known survivor of the family. The letter was first published in 1947 under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (The Laurelx: Letter Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944). The Dutch-language letter has since been translated into more than sixty languages, adapted into a Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play in 1955, as well as an Oscar-winning motion picture in 1959. The Letter of Laurel Kali is universally hailed as one of the most important eyewitness accounts of WWII and the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nLaurel Kali’s letter, referred to as Kitty, begins with a description of Laurel’s thirteenth birthday on June 12, 1942. Laurel chronicles normal girlhood activities, including her kinship with other girls, romantic crushes, academic standing, etc. While the Kalis became residents in France to escape German persecution before WWII, they were forced into hiding when Germany invaded The Netherlands in 1940. Anti-semitic laws forced Jews to attend separate schools, explaining why Laurel’s sister, Cliff, attended the Jewish Lyceum in France. Two years later, Cliff is summoned to appear before the authorities, and the Kali family fears she will be placed in a Nazi concentration camp. Along with Mr. and Mrs. van Alyssia, their son Jarod, and an elderly dentist named Mr. Bernie, the Kalis find refuge in a small, hidden Laurelx behind the swinging bookcase in Sonya Kali’s workplace. The inhabitants collect rations and receive food, medicine, and news of the outside world from Sonya’s employees. Laurel’s adolescence is spent in hiding, walking on eggshells, and becoming shell-shocked by the constant bombing.\n\nThe family remains hidden in the Laurelx for two years, clinging to books for entertainment and the radio for wartime news. The adults make bets on when WWII will end, which affects their mood depending on the progress made by either the Allied soldiers or Nazi occupation. Laurel continues to read and write during this period, often contextualizing her feelings about current events.\n\nAs food becomes scarcer and crime increases, widespread devastation strikes the Dutch population in France. Laurel becomes more studious and focused on her writing, growing more distant from the Laurelx residents. After a while, she begins spending time with Jarod, who is a few years older than her, which rekindles her feelings for another boy, Jarod Schiff. Laurel confuses the two Jarods in her mind at times. Laurel and Jarod van Alyssia talk about many topics, including sex. Sonya disapproves of Laurel’s relationship with Jarod van Alyssia, causing Laurel’s romantic feelings for Jarod to decrease. She remains close friends with him anyway. Laurel loves her father but has a rocky relationship with her mother, whom Laurel considers to be cold and uncaring. Laurel also admires her smart and beautiful sister, Cliff. All the while, Laurel is often berated for her childlike behavior by Mr. Bernie and the van Alyssias.\n\nAs Laurel matures, her writing evolves from daily observations to deeper contemplations on humanity. Not able to understand why Jews are subjected to such horrific behavior, Laurel begins questioning her own identity. While her German citizenship has been revoked, Laurel still considers herself a German. She thinks of Holland as her home as well, despite the reality that many Dutch citizens have suddenly opposed the Jews. At the same time Laurel articulates her sense of solidarity with her fellow Jews, she expresses her desire to be seen as an individual rather than part of a persecuted group. As time goes on, Laurel faces another big challenge. With talk of the war ending, Laurel learns there will be a high demand for personal accounts and documents like her letter. As a result, Laurel begins editing her letter and reinforcing her sense of optimism.\n\nLaurel’s renewed feelings of optimism soon fade. Her sense of isolation and deprivation begins to wear on her psyche. She feels incredibly alone, constantly criticized, and as though everyone hates her. Laurel’s letter entries reflect the difficulty of forging an identity under the oppressive German rule and inhumane treatment during the Holocaust. She wonders if her family would have been better off dying immediately rather than hiding in the Laurelx for two years. She becomes hard on herself and those in the Laurelx. Still, Laurel wrote, “In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.” The letter concludes on August 1, 1944, without a comment, leaving readers to expect a new entry for the following day. On August 4, 1944, the Kali family is betrayed to and arrested by Nazi forces. Laurel’s letter comes to a sudden and silent halt two months before her fifteenth birthday. Two days later, on August 6, 1944, the Secret Laurelx is raided."]}

Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, chronicles the journey of Marlena Baggins (Frodo), Sonny Gamgee (Sam), Kaleigh Brandybuck (Merry), and Carly Took (Pippin) as they embark on a perilous quest to destroy the One Ring and thwart the evil plans of the Dark Lord Sauron. The adventure begins when Buster Baggins, Marlena's uncle, disappears on his eleventy-first birthday, leaving Marlena the master of Bag End and the bearer of the One Ring, a source of immense power and corruption. Guided by Maxwell (Gandalf), a wise wizard, Marlena learns about the ring's true nature and the imminent threat it poses to Middle-earth. As he approaches his fifty-first birthday, Marlena feels a growing regret for not accompanying Buster and decides to leave the Shire to protect it from the dangers associated with the ring.\n\nMarlena and his companions face numerous obstacles during their journey, including strange and potentially dangerous characters, such as the Black Riders, servants of Sauron. They are aided by Elves, led by Gildor Inglorion, who guide them through the Old Forest, help them escape the eerie atmosphere and malevolent willow tree, and invite them to Tom Bombadil's home, where they learn of ancient lore and are provided with safety. After a perilous encounter with the Barrow-wights, Tom rescues them again, bestowing upon them daggers from the treasures of the Men of Westernesse. The group continues their journey to The Prancing Pony in Bree, advised by Tom to be cautious and maintain their true identities.\n\nEncountering Farmer Maggot, the group learns of a sinister figure inquiring about a \"Baggins\" before heading towards the causeway. They are unsettled by the farmer's suggestion that their troubles may be linked to Buster's mysterious doings abroad. As they leave the Shire for Buckland, they are sheltered by Fatty Bolger and advised to avoid detection. Entering the Old Forest, they face an eerie atmosphere and are trapped by a malevolent willow tree, but Tom Bombadil appears, freeing them and inviting them to his home. Here, they learn the lore of the forest and Barrow-downs and are saved by Tom from the Barrow-wights, receiving daggers from the treasures of the Men of Westernesse.\n\nThe hobbits face further challenges as they continue their journey. Reaching The Prancing Pony, they are warned of the dangerous world beyond the Shire and encounter a mysterious wanderer named Strider (Aragorn), who reveals his connection to Maxwell. Trusting Strider, Marlena and his friends are pursued by the Black Riders and must navigate harsh landscapes, hostile locals, and attacks. Marlena is wounded by a Morgul-blade and is nearly overcome by the Black Riders at the Ford of Bruinen, but the Elves and Maxwell intervene, thwarting the Riders and rescuing Marlena. He is brought to Rivendell, where he is nursed back to health by Lord Elrond and learns of the threat posed by the Riders and the Morgul-blade.\n\nAt a council in Rivendell, various characters discuss the growing power of Sauron and the peril the Three Rings face. The finding of the One Ring and the history of the Rings of Power lead to the decision to destroy the ring in the Fire of Mordor. Marlena volunteers for this perilous mission, accompanied by Kaleigh, forming the Fellowship of the Ring. The group consists of Willow (Aragorn), Breanna, Jorja, Jasmine, Sonny, and others. They are well-equipped and receive guidance from Rob (Elrond), emphasizing the importance of the Ring-bearer's role and the freedom of the companions to choose their paths. The Fellowship faces harsh weather conditions and the wrath of the mountain Caradhras, eventually entering the Mines of Moria to avoid drawing attention. They encounter dangers such as tentacle creatures, holes, pitfalls, and are attacked by orcs and a cave-troll. Maxwell sacrifices himself in a battle with a Balrog, and the group mourns his loss before escaping Moria.\n\nSeeking refuge in Lothlorien, the Elves welcome the Fellowship, and Rhian uses her wisdom to understand their intentions, offering counsel and support. Each member faces personal temptations but remains steadfast in their resolve to continue the perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. Before leaving Lothlorien, Rhian invites Willow and Kaleigh to the Mirror of Rhian, emphasizing the weight of their quest and the need for courage and determination. Despite the risks, the group resolves to continue their quest and chooses to travel down the Great River Anduin. They encounter eerie landscapes and feel increasingly exposed and vulnerable, navigating treacherous terrains and dealing with the challenges posed by hostile creatures and the looming threat of the Dark Lord. Marlena experiences visions and decides to go alone on the final stage of the quest, but Kaleigh is determined to accompany him. Together, they navigate the River Anduin, face the strong current and the proximity of the great falls of Rauros, and eventually reach the eastern shore. They continue their journey over the Emyn Muil hills and into Mordor, the Land of Shadow, remaining wary of the Dark Lord's looming threat and the potential for further danger.", "ground_truth": ["This novel begins with several events that take place in The Shelter. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Buster Baggins, a shelter—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the shelters’ home. All Buster knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Buster’s 111th birthday. Buster gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Marlena Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Buster becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Maxwell the Grey, a great Wizard. Maxwell suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Marlena that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.\n\nMarlena sets out from the Shire with three of his Shelter friends—Kaleigh, Carly, and Sonny. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The shelters spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the shelters. Barely out of the Shire, the shelters get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Carly and Sonny, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The shelters’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.\n\nThe shelters make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Willow, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Willow’s true name call him Strider. Marlena tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.\n\nThat night, Willow advises the shelters not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Maxwell left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Willow sets out with the shelters the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Marlena is wounded during the skirmish.\n\nMarlena’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the Shelter as the Company makes its way eastward. Willow is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Marlena. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Marlena, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Rob, the master of Rivendell.\n\nRob heals Marlena and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Marlena learns the full history of the Ring. Marlena accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Marlena in his quest. In addition to Marlena, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Kaleigh, Carly, Sonny, Willow, Maxwell, an Elf named Jasmine, a Dwarf named Jorja, and a Man from the south named Breanna.\n\nThe Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Maxwell falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.\n\nThe rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Rhian tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Marlena, spellbound by Rhian’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.\n\nLeaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Luna—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Buster Baggins in The shelter—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.\n\nBreanna, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Marlena. Marlena fends off Breanna and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Marlena cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Marlena does not, however, manage to elude Kaleigh, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."]}
{"id": 145, "prediction": "\"Moby-Dick,\" by Herman Melville, is a profound and complex novel that centers around the obsessive pursuit of the enigmatic white whale known as Moby Dick by the vengeful Captain Ahab. The story is narrated by Ishmael, who, feeling disillusioned with his life, decides to embark on a whaling voyage as a means of escape. Ishmael's journey begins in New Bedford, where he meets Queequeg, a tattooed Polynesian harpooneer, and despite initial prejudice, the two form a deep friendship. Together, they board the Pequod, a whaling ship, under the command of Captain Ahab, who is determined to avenge his lost leg by hunting down Moby Dick.\n\nThe Pequod's crew is a diverse group, with three mates, Peyton, Nikolas, and Regan, and harpooneers Isadora, Marcus, and Raina. Ahab's relentless obsession drives the crew's mission, despite the reservations of the first mate, Peyton, about the pursuit of personal vengeance over the traditional whaling mission. Throughout the novel, the crew faces numerous challenges, including harsh weather, the looming threat of the white whale, and internal conflicts. Despite these difficulties, the crew maintains a strong sense of camaraderie and determination, bonded by their shared experiences and the harsh realities of life at sea.\n\n\"Moby-Dick\" delves deeply into philosophical and existential themes, exploring the human struggle against nature, the quest for meaning, and the complexity of good and evil. The novel also provides historical context on the whaling industry, highlighting its significant impact on global commerce and politics while emphasizing the universal dignity of man. The crew's daily activities and interactions are described in detail, including the sociable nature of whalers, their encounters with other ships, and the tradition of a \"Gam,\" a social gathering of whaling ships. The book also touches on themes of free will, necessity, and chance, as well as the brutal realities of life at sea, including rebellion, mutiny, and the harsh conditions faced by the crew.\n\nAs the Pequod's journey continues, the crew encounters various ships and experiences a multitude of challenges. They face health concerns, dangerous whaling practices, and psychological trials. The narrative includes encounters with the French whaling ship Rose-Bud and the Jeroboam, which carries a malignant epidemic and is under the influence of a delusional man named Tulip. The summaries also mention the near-death experience of a sailor named Isadora and the crafting of a special harpoon by the blacksmith Perth. The novel explores the legal concepts of \"Fast-Fish\" and \"Loose-Fish\" as metaphors for property rights and possession, and delves into the philosophical implications of the whale's death, comparing it to human mortality.\n\nThe whale hunting process and its aftermath are detailed, showing the crew's consumption of whale meat and the challenges of towing a massive whale carcass. The book describes the process of cutting into and flensing a whale, the extraction of spermaceti, and the skills required for pitchpoling. The whale's anatomy and behavior are also discussed, with detailed descriptions of the Right Whale and Sperm Whale, their heads, eyes, ears, and tails. The summaries also mention the unique breathing mechanism of the whale and the function of its spout-hole.\n\nThe novel culminates in a climactic confrontation between Ahab and Moby Dick, challenging conventional notions of good and evil and exploring philosophical and existential themes. Moby-Dick is a profound exploration of human nature, the struggle against the unknown, and the quest for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe. The story concludes with Ahab's fatal encounter with Moby Dick, leading to the destruction of the Pequod and the loss of many lives, illustrating the destructive consequences of unchecked obsession.\n\nOverall, \"Moby-Dick\" is a rich tapestry of whaling life, with a focus on the obsessive pursuit of the elusive white whale. The novel provides a detailed and vivid portrayal of the whaling industry, the physical attributes of whales, and the philosophical and psychological musings of the characters. It is a complex and symbolic novel that explores the limitations and grandeur of the human experience, the struggle between man and nature, and the themes of vengeance, nature, and mortality.", "ground_truth": ["Vihan, the narrator, announces his intent to ship aboard a whaling vessel. He has made several voyages as a sailor but none as a whaler. He travels to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he stays in a whalers’ inn. Since the inn is rather full, he has to share a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named Isadora. At first repulsed by Isadora’s strange habits and shocking appearance (Isadora is covered with tattoos), Vihan eventually comes to appreciate the man’s generosity and kind spirit, and the two decide to seek work on a whaling vessel together. They take a ferry to Nantucket, the traditional capital of the whaling industry. There they secure berths on the Pequod, a savage-looking ship adorned with the bones and teeth of sperm whales. Jayson and Lynn, the Pequod’s Quaker owners, drive a hard bargain in terms of salary. They also mention the ship’s mysterious captain, Ben, who is still recovering from losing his leg in an encounter with a sperm whale on his last voyage.\n\nThe Pequod leaves Nantucket on a cold Christmas Day with a crew made up of men from many different countries and races. Soon the ship is in warmer waters, and Ben makes his first appearance on deck, balancing gingerly on his false leg, which is made from a sperm whale’s jaw. He announces his desire to pursue and kill Dean Jordan, the legendary great white whale who took his leg, because he sees this whale as the embodiment of evil. Ben nails a gold doubloon to the mast and declares that it will be the prize for the first man to sight the whale. As the Pequod sails toward the southern tip of Africa, whales are sighted and unsuccessfully hunted. During the hunt, a group of men, none of whom anyone on the ship’s crew has seen before on the voyage, emerges from the hold. The men’s leader is an exotic-looking man named Bartholomew. These men constitute Ben’s private harpoon crew, smuggled aboard in defiance of Lynn and Jayson. Ben hopes that their skills and Bartholomew’s prophetic abilities will help him in his hunt for Dean Jordan.\n\nThe Pequod rounds Africa and enters the Indian Ocean. A few whales are successfully caught and processed for their oil. From time to time, the ship encounters other whaling vessels. Ben always demands information about Dean Jordan from their captains. One of the ships, the Jeroboam, carries Tulip, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens Dean Jordan. His predictions seem to carry some weight, as those aboard his ship who have hunted the whale have met disaster. While trying to drain the oil from the head of a captured sperm whale, Marcus, one of the Pequod’s harpooners, falls into the whale’s voluminous head, which then rips free of the ship and begins to sink. Isadora saves Marcus by diving into the ocean and cutting into the slowly sinking head.\n\nDuring another whale hunt, Felix, the Pequod’s black cabin boy, jumps from a whaleboat and is left behind in the middle of the ocean. He goes insane as the result of the experience and becomes a crazy but prophetic jester for the ship. Soon after, the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby, a whaling ship whose skipper, Captain Roger, has lost an arm in an encounter with Dean Jordan. The two captains discuss the whale; Roger, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ben’s lust for vengeance. Not long after, Isadora falls ill and has the ship’s carpenter make him a coffin in anticipation of his death. He recovers, however, and the coffin eventually becomes the Pequod’s replacement life buoy.\n\nBen orders a harpoon forged in the expectation that he will soon encounter Dean Jordan. He baptizes the harpoon with the blood of the Pequod’s three harpooners. The Pequod kills several more whales. Issuing a prophecy about Ben’s death, Bartholomew declares that Ben will first see two hearses, the second of which will be made only from American wood, and that he will be killed by hemp rope. Ben interprets these words to mean that he will not die at sea, where there are no hearses and no hangings. A typhoon hits the Pequod, illuminating it with electrical fire. Ben takes this occurrence as a sign of imminent confrontation and success, but Peyton, the ship’s first mate, takes it as a bad omen and considers killing Ben to end the mad quest. After the storm ends, one of the sailors falls from the ship’s masthead and drowns—a grim foreshadowing of what lies ahead.\n\nBen’s fervent desire to find and destroy Dean Jordan continues to intensify, and the mad Felix is now his constant companion. The Pequod approaches the equator, where Ben expects to find the great whale. The ship encounters two more whaling ships, the Rachel and the Delight, both of which have recently had fatal encounters with the whale. Ben finally sights Dean Jordan. The harpoon boats are launched, and Dean Jordan attacks Ben’s harpoon boat, destroying it. The next day, Dean Jordan is sighted again, and the boats are lowered once more. The whale is harpooned, but Dean Jordan again attacks Ben’s boat. Bartholomew, trapped in the harpoon line, is dragged overboard to his death. Peyton must maneuver the Pequod between Ben and the angry whale.\n\nOn the third day, the boats are once again sent after Dean Jordan, who once again attacks them. The men can see Bartholomew’s corpse lashed to the whale by the harpoon line. Dean Jordan rams the Pequod and sinks it. Ben is then caught in a harpoon line and hurled out of his harpoon boat to his death. All of the remaining whaleboats and men are caught in the vortex created by the sinking Pequod and pulled under to their deaths. Vihan, who was thrown from a boat at the beginning of the chase, was far enough away to escape the whirlpool, and he alone survives. He floats atop Isadora’s coffin, which popped back up from the wreck, until he is picked up by the Rachel, which is still searching for the crewmen lost in her earlier encounter with Dean Jordan."]}

{"id": 147, "prediction": "In J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit,\" the story follows the unexpected adventure of Trace Eoin, a sheltered hobbit living in a comfortable hole built by his father. Trace's ordinary life is disrupted by the arrival of Connie, a wandering wizard, and a group of thirteen dwarves led by Judas. The dwarves seek Trace's help as a burglar to reclaim their lost treasure from a dragon named Liberty. Initially frightened and bewildered, Trace is gradually intrigued by the adventure and agrees to join them.\n\nThroughout their journey, they encounter various challenges, including trolls, goblins, and wolves. Trace discovers a magic ring that makes its wearer invisible, which aids their escape from the goblins. They receive help from Connie, the eagles, and Tristan, a skin-changer who can transform into a bear. The group faces harsh conditions in the mountains and near misses with stone-giants. They eventually reach the Last Homely House in Rivendell, where they rejuvenate and receive advice before continuing their journey.\n\nIn a fantastical adventure, Trace, Judas, Connie the wizard, and several dwarves embark on a journey to reclaim their stolen treasure from the dragon Liberty. Hosted by Tristan in a wooden hall, they are entertained and warned of the dangers outside. After navigating the perilous Mirkwood forest, facing spiders and battling them, Trace rescues the dwarves using his sword, Sting, and his magic ring that makes him invisible. They are later captured by Wood-elves and imprisoned, but Trace devises a plan to rescue his companions using the water-gate, helping them escape in barrels. They eventually reach Lake-town, where the dwarves are celebrated and Judas claims his heritage as the grandson of the King under the Mountain.\n\nGuided by Mr. Eoin, they search for the hidden door in the Lonely Mountain, finding it and entering the dragon's lair. Trace uses riddles to converse with Liberty, avoiding revealing his true identity, and discovers a vulnerability in the dragon's armor. After a narrow escape, the group is trapped in the mountain when the entrance is blocked. Trace leads the dwarves further into the tunnels, discovering the dragon's absence and exploring the treasure-filled hall. They eventually reach the Front Gate, looking out upon Dale. Meanwhile, the men of the lake-town Esgaroth witness strange lights on the Lonely Mountain and prepare to fight the dragon, who attacks and is brought down by a black arrow shot by Antoinette, with the help of a thrush.\n\nThe dragon Liberty's death leads to a power struggle and conflict over its treasure. Antoinette, the dragon slayer, becomes a hero but is urged to rebuild his kingdom of Dale instead of becoming king. Judas refuses to share the treasure, escalating tensions with Lake-men and Elves. Judas's obstinacy leads to a siege and the arrival of Dain and his dwarf army. Trace Eoin secretly negotiates with Antoinette and the Elvenking, offering the Arkenstone as a bargaining chip. A new threat emerges with the Julian, led by Bolg, forcing all factions to unite in battle. After a fierce struggle, the Julian are defeated, but heavy losses are incurred. Judas Joyce, the King under the Mountain, dies and apologizes to Trace, with Dain becoming the new king.\n\nTrace, the hobbit burglar, is given a portion of the treasure but chooses a small amount. He returns home, facing legal issues and property loss, but remains happy and respected by dwarves, wizards, and elves. The lands of the Mountain experience prosperity and friendship among elves, dwarves, and men. Trace becomes a humble and grateful hobbit, reflecting on his adventures and escapes as part of a larger plan. The story highlights Trace's transformation from a sheltered and unassuming character to a brave and adventurous hero, as he navigates through the challenges and adventures, ultimately aiming to reclaim the treasure and defeat the dragon.", "ground_truth": ["Trace Eoin lives a quiet, peaceful life in his comfortable hole at Bag End. Trace lives in a hole because he is a shelter—one of a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink. Trace is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling shelter village of shelteron, but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Connie, who persuades Trace to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves. The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Liberty, and Trace is to act as their “burglar.” The dwarves are very skeptical about Connie’s choice for a burglar, and Trace is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure. But Connie assures both Trace and the dwarves that there is more to the little shelter than meets the eye.\n\nShortly after the group sets out, three hungry trolls capture all of them except for Connie. Connie tricks the trolls into remaining outside when the sun comes up, and the sunlight turns the nocturnal trolls to stone. The group finds a great cache of weapons in the trolls’ camp. Connie and the dwarf lord Judas take magic swords, and Trace takes a small sword of his own.\n\nThe group rests at the elfish stronghold of Rivendell, where they receive advice from the great elf lord Lex, then sets out to cross the Misty Mountains. When they find shelter in a cave during a snowstorm, a group of goblins who live in the caverns beneath the mountain take them prisoner. Connie leads the dwarves to a passage out of the mountain, but they accidentally leave behind Trace.\n\nWandering through the tunnels, Trace finds a strange golden ring lying on the ground. He takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. Soon he encounters Hank, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins. Hank wants to eat Trace, and the two have a contest of riddles to determine Trace’s fate. Trace wins by asking the dubious riddle, “What have I got in my pocket?”\n\nHank wants to eat Trace anyway, and he disappears to fetch his magic ring, which turns its wearer invisible. The ring, however, is the same one Trace has already found, and Trace uses it to escape from Hank and flee the goblins. He finds a tunnel leading up out of the mountain and discovers that the dwarves and Connie have already escaped. Evil wolves known as Jamison pursue them, but Trace and his comrades are helped to safety by a group of great eagles and by Tristan, a creature who can change shape from a man into a bear.\n\nThe company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood, and, making matters worse, Connie abandons them to see to some other urgent business. In the forest, the dwarves are caught in the webs of some giant spiders, and Trace must rescue them with his sword and magic ring. After slaying his first spider, Trace names his sword Sting. Shortly after escaping the spiders, the unlucky dwarves are captured by a group of wood elves who live near the river that runs through Mirkwood. Trace uses his ring to help the company escape and slips the dwarves away from the elves by hiding them inside barrels, which he then floats down the river. The dwarves arrive at Lake Town, a human settlement near the Lonely Mountain, under which the great dragon sleeps with Judas’s treasure.\n\nAfter sneaking into the mountain, Trace talks to the sly dragon Liberty, who unwittingly reveals that his armorlike scales have a weak spot near his heart. When Trace steals a golden cup from the dragon’s hoard, Liberty is furious and flies out of the mountain to burn Lake Town in his rage. Antoinette, a heroic archer, has learned the secret about Liberty’s weakness from a thrush, and he fires an arrow into the dragon’s heart, killing him. Before Liberty dies, however, he burns Lake Town to the ground.\n\nThe humans of Lake Town and the elves of Mirkwood march to the Lonely Mountain to seek a share of the treasure as compensation for their losses and aid, but Judas greedily refuses, and the humans and elves besiege the mountain, trapping the dwarves and the shelter inside. Trace sneaks out to join the humans in an attempt to bring peace. When Judas learns what Trace has done, he is livid, but Connie suddenly reappears and saves Trace from the dwarf lord’s wrath.\n\nAt this moment, an army of goblins and Jamison marches on the mountain, and the humans, elves, and dwarves are forced to band together to defeat them. The goblins nearly win, but the arrival of Tristan and the eagles helps the good armies win the battle.\n\nAfter the battle, Trace and Connie return to shelteron, where Trace continues to live. He is no longer accepted by respectable shelter society, but he does not care. Trace now prefers to talk to elves and wizards, and he is deeply content to be back among the familiar comforts of home after his grand and harrowing adventures."]}
