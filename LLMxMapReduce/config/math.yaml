Read the article portion and follow my instructions to process it.\n\nArticle:\nThe article begins as follows:\n{context}\nThe article concludes here.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nInstructions:\n\nPlease extract information from the provided passage to try and answer the given question. Note that you only have a part of the entire text, so the information you obtain might not fully answer the question. Therefore, please provide your rationale for using the extracted information to answer the question and include a confidence score. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract Relevant Information: Identify and highlight the key pieces of information from the passage that are relevant to the given question.\n2. Rationale: Analyze the extracted information and explain how it can be used to address the question. If the information is incomplete, discuss any assumptions or inferences you need to make.\n3. Answer the Question: Based on your rationale, provide the best possible answer to the question.If, after providing your rationale, you believe the passage does not contain any information to solve the question, please output \"[NO INFORMATION]\" as the answer.\n4. Confidence Score: Give a confidence score (out of 5) for your final answer based on the completeness, relevance, and reliability of the integrated information and your rationale process.

Integrate Extracted Information: Collect and summarize all the evidence relevant to solving the question. Focus on integrating the information from different chunks, rather than just relying on confidence scores. Ensure to extract the most relevant information that addresses the question effectively.\n2. Analyze: Re-analyze the question using the integrated information. Consider the reliability (confidence scores) and how directly each piece of information addresses the question. Prioritize highly relevant information while accounting for potential errors due to incomplete data.\n3. Answer the Question: Provide the best possible answer based on the updated information. If, after providing your rationale, you believe the passage does not contain any information to solve the question, please output \"[NO INFORMATION]\" as the answer. Use the confidence scores to support the reliability of your final answer, prioritizing higher confidence information.\n4.
